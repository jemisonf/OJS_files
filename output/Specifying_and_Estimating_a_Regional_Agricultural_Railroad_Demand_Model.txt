INTRODUCTION

The  last  three  decades  have  witnessed  tremendous  change  in  the  U.S.  rail  freight  industry. The 
Staggers Rail Act of 1980 led to major restructuring of the industry. The act gave railroads the ability 
to set any rate between variable cost and 80% above variable cost, without regulatory review.  The 
act prohibited railroads from discussing local rates in rate bureaus establishing the conditions for 
intrarailroad price competition. Railroads were given the ability to enter into rail/shipper contracts 
that contributed to increases in rail market shares. The Staggers Act accelerated the decision process 
for abandonment and merger decisions to promote railroad cost reductions.
 
In 1980 there were 40 Class I railroads, which has declined to seven in 2011. Thus there have 
been numerous consolidations and mergers that have restructured the industry. Both shippers and 
railroads  benefit  from  end-to-end  mergers  (mergers  of  railroads  that  previously  served  different 
territories).  Shippers  experience  reduced  inventory  and  stockout  costs  due  to  reduced  transit 
times as the merged railroad is able to ship commodities over longer distances without having to 
interchange freight with other railroads.  Shippers also benefit from direct access to more markets 
and fewer record-keeping costs. Railroads benefit from end-to-end mergers by gaining access to a 
larger territory, fostering more differential pricing opportunities. Railroads also reduce costs as a 
result of the economies of scale resulting from a merger.
  Miles of track owned by Class I railroads fell from 270,623 miles in 1980 to 161,926 miles in 
2010, a 40.2% decline (AAR 2011).  Some of the 108,697 miles of track were abandoned, but a 
large share of these lines were sold to Class II (regional railroads) and Class III (local railroads). The 
Association of American Railroads (2011) defines regional railroads as line-haul railroads below 
the Class I revenue threshold ($398.7 million in 2011) operating at least 350 miles of road and/or 
earning annual revenue between $40 million and the Class I revenue threshold.  Local railroads are 
line-haul railroads below the regional criteria, and switching and terminal railroads. The number of 
regional railroads fell from 27 in 1987 to 21 in 2010 (a 22% decrease) while the number of local 
railroads rose from 457 (1987) to 537 (2010), a 17.5% increase (ASLRRA 2012). Thus the total 
number of Class II and III railroads increased from 484 (1987) to 558 (2010) a gain of 15.3%. In 
2010, regional and local railroads accounted for 31% of U.S. track miles and 10.3% of U.S. rail 
industry employment (AAR 2011).
 
The  U.S.  freight  railroad  industry  has  achieved  tremendous  advances  in  labor  productivity.  
Freight revenue ton miles per employee rose from 2.1 million in 1980 to 11.2 million in 2010, a 

35

JTRF Volume 53 No. 1, Spring 2014433% gain (AAR 2011).  Freight revenue ton-miles per employee hour increased from 863 in 1980 
to 4505 in 2010, a 422% increase (AAR 2011).1
 
The productivity gains have contributed to improved financial condition of the Class I railroad 
industry. Net railway operating income rose from $1,338.6 million in 1980 to $9,959.2 million in 
2010, a 644% increase (AAR 2011).  The rate of return on net investment rose from 4.22% in 1980 
to 10.36% in 2010, while the rate of return on shareholders’ equity increased from 6.01% (1980) to 
11.23% (2010) (AAR 2011).
 
The objective of the paper is to examine the demand for railroad grain transportation over this 
period of change to obtain own price and cross price elasticities, and to determine if rail demand 
differs between east and west regions, which has rarely been investigated.  Major grain crops (wheat, 
corn, sorghum, and soybeans) are a good case study commodity for railroad demand because of the 
large  gains  in  railroad  tonnage.  Collectively,  farm  products  accounted  for  8.6%  of  total  Class  I 
railroad tons originated in 2010, which was only exceeded by chemicals and coal (AAR 2011).2  
Between 1970 and 2011, total railroad tons originated of the four above named crops collectively 
increased by 48.3%, with most of the gains occurring in corn and soybeans (AAR 2012).
 
The  measurement  of  railroad  grain  transportation  demand  is  important  to  railroads,  grain 
exporters, grain marketing companies, and barge operators. Railroads need grain demand model 
forecasts as an input to equipment planning and staffing decisions. Price elasticities obtained from 
the demand models can indicate which markets offer the best opportunities for increased revenue 
as a result of specific price changes. Cross price elasticities with respect to barge prices reveal the 
impact on railroad demand of competitive price changes instituted by water carriers. Grain exporters 
and grain marketing companies could use information from railroad grain demand models as an 
input to their logistics system planning. Barge operators need to know railroad grain demand to 
formulate competitive strategy.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Miklius,  Casavant,  and  Garrod  (1976)  apply  a  logit  model  to  estimate  the  price  elasticities  and 
cross  elasticities  for  freight  transport  service.  The  model  is  applied  to  a  sample  of  cherry  and 
apple shipments. The cherry shipments are from Washington, Oregon, and Montana, and the apple 
shipments originated in Washington. The authors selected cherries because of their high perishability.  
Thus,  quality  of  service  would  be  expected  to  be  a  major  factor  in  mode  selection. Apples  are 
storable for longer time periods; thus, modal selection would be expected to be responsive to modal 
rate differences.

The authors specify a binary choice model where the shipper choice is a function of rail and 
truck rates, transit times, and transit time dependabilities. Elasticities for own-price and cross price 
elasticities are calculated for both rail and truck. Most of the coefficients of both the cherry and 
apple models have the theoretically expected sign and are statistically significant.

The authors found that in the cherry model the demand for both rail and truck service was 
relatively elastic, not only for its own price and transit time but also with respect to those of the 
competing mode. For cherries, the choice of transport mode was much more sensitive to transit time 
than rates.

The authors concluded the results for the apple model were less satisfactory than the cherry 
model. The apple model had an unexpected sign for rail transit time, and the coefficient for truck 
transit time was statistically insignificant.

Oum (1979) formulated a demand model for intercity freight transport as an intermediate input 
to the production and distribution sectors of the economy, and to estimate the price elasticities and 
the elasticities of substitution between the major freight modes (rail, truck, and water).

36

Railroad Demand ModelThe  author  used  a  twice  continuously  differentiable  production  function  relating  the  gross 
output to capital, labor, and freight transport. The data are from the Canadian economy 1945-1974 
and were transformed using a price index for each mode to calculate the revenue per ton mile.

The author found that the demand for railway freight services is only slightly responsive to 
the change in railway freight rates; but the own-price elasticity has been increasing in absolute 
value  over  time. Also,  railway  and  motor  carriers  exhibited  a  complementary  relationship  until 
1955 when they started competing heavily with one another. There is also a highly competitive 
relationship between rail and water carriers that can be seen throughout all years of data, but it has 
been decreasing slightly over time.

Friedlaender  and  Spady  (1980)  analyzed  the  demand  for  freight  transportation  with  freight 
being a productive input in the firm that should be treated like any other input, and the full costs of 
transportation should include inventory costs as well as shipping and storage. The authors derive 
an explicit freight demand equation from a general cost function recognizing the interrelationship 
between  rates  and  inventory  cost  through  shipment  characteristics.  The  demand  equation  was 
generated from a cost function that uses labor, capital, materials and energy, rail transportation, and 
truck transportation to produce an aggregate output.

The authors find that commodities such as iron and steel products, electrical machinery, and 
food  appear  to  have  an  elastic  demand.  By  region,  the  demand  for  rail  service  in  the  southern 
region appeared to be elastic. The cross price elasticities between rail and truck service were low in 
absolute value across all goods in all areas, suggesting a large amount of independence between the 
two modes.  The authors note that this was reasonable since most of the data for trucks they used 
were for LTL shipments, which are not a strong competitor for rail service.

Winston (1981) noted that previous work in freight transportation has focused on the aggregate 
approach  without  considering  the  underlying  behavior  of  the  firms  responsible  for  actually 
making the mode-choice decision.  The author examined these choices as they apply to intermodal 
competition. This was done by developing a random expected utility model that was suitable for 
econometric analysis comparing both regulated and unregulated motor freight and rail.

The  author  made  expected  utility  a  function  of  modal  attributes,  and  commodity  and  firm 
characteristics that were divided into two different elements: observed and unobserved parts. This 
was further disaggregated into the observed part and a stochastic term representative of a random 
parameter, modal attributes, and an independent identically distributed disturbance.

It  was  found  that  the  commodity  groups  most  sensitive  to  service  quality  are  perishable 
products or inputs to perishable products.  Conversely, the commodity groups that are least sensitive 
to service quality are neither perishable nor likely to have storage problems such as high storage 
costs or unstable demand. Generally, freight charges and location had the most explanatory power, 
with tangible shipping costs tending to play a dominant role in mode choice decisions.

Babcock and German (1982) forecast national and regional rail demand for selected agricultural 
commodities  including  wheat,  corn,  sorghum,  and  soybeans.  The  forecasting  models  are  single 
equation regression employing annual data from the 1958-1980 period. Each model is estimated for 
the United States and for the east, south, and west regions.

The dependent variable for each of the crop models was rail tons originated of the commodity.  
Independent variables for each model included crop production, crop exports, and a time trend. The 
corn model also had cattle on feed in addition to the above mentioned variables. The soybean model 
also contained the barge share of combined rail and barge tonnage.

The  empirical  results  of  the  model  were  good  with  high  R2s  and  no  autocorrelation.  The 
exception was the soybean equations, which had significant autocorrelation and was corrected using 
the Cochrane-Orcult method. The explanatory variables generally had the theoretically expected 
sign and are highly significant.

The authors obtained 1985 forecast values for each of the explanatory variables to forecast 1985 

railroad crop demand.

JTRF Volume 53 No. 1, Spring 2014Babcock  and  German  (1983)  forecasted  1985  railroad  market  shares  for  12  intercity 
manufactured goods freight markets. The authors noted that the railroad share of these markets 
declined in the 1955-1980 period while the truck share rose. One of the principal objectives of the 
Staggers Rail Act of 1980 was to arrest the decline of rail market shares. Whether this would occur 
was the primary question addressed by this paper.

The authors employed a model in which railroad market share (measured by ratio of a rail 
tonnage index to an index of industrial production) is made a function of the ratio of the rail rate 
to the truck rate, the prime interest rate, and the ratio of truck service to rail service.  Truck service 
was measured by interstate highway miles as a percent of total highway miles.  Rail service was 
measured by an index of average daily freight car miles. The authors found the potential forecast 
performance of the estimated rail share equations to be excellent.

The authors also found that rail market shares would continue to decline in about half of the 12 
markets if truck service improved relative to rail service.  If the decline in rail service relative to truck 
service was arrested, railroad market shares increased in all 12 markets. The principal conclusion 
of the paper was that the secular decline of railroads was ending in most transport markets by the 
middle 1980s.

The purpose of the Wilson, Wilson, and Koo (1988) paper is to analyze the market for transport 
services and the behavior of modal rates, and to identify critical parameters affecting rail market 
power they estimate modal demand and supply functions from time series data.

The theoretical model is a dominant firm (the railroad) price leadership model with differentiated 
services. Price-taking motor carriers form the competitive fringe.  Thus, the transport market consists 
of two highly interdependent submarkets, one for rail and the other for trucks. They form demand 
functions in which truck and rail demand are functions of truck and rail price. The rail decision 
process includes some conjecture on the market response of trucks. Thus, the rail demand includes 
the rail price and the competitive price response of trucks.

In the empirical model, a recursive system is specified with two blocks. One describes rail 
pricing and the other a system of structural equations and equilibrium conditions.  The second block 
includes structural equations for intermodal competition and simultaneously determines equilibrium 
values of modal outputs and truck rates. The rail demand function is QRDt = f(PRt, PTt, Ct, Ut) where 
QRD is rail shipments, PT is truck rates, PR is rail rates, C is an index of railcar availability (reflects 
service quality), and U is a dummy variable equal to 1.0 after multi-car shipments were introduced.  
Truck demand is a function of the same variables.

The equation was estimated for wheat from North Dakota to Minneapolis and Duluth from 
1973 to 1983 in monthly frequency. All the explanatory variables had the theoretically expected 
sign and were statistically significant.  The equation had a good fit and there was no autocorrelation.
The  authors  found  that  in  the  pre-Staggers  period,  the  rail  own-price  elasticity  of  demand 
was -1.18 and the cross price elasticity was 2.30.  In the post-Staggers period, the corresponding 
elasticities  were  -1.46  and  2.54.  Own-price  elasticities  for  truck  were  -0.73  in  the  pre-Staggers 
period and the cross price elasticity was 0.70. In the post-Staggers period, the corresponding figures 
were -13.4 and 8.29.

Yu  and  Fuller  (2005)  estimated  the  structural  demand  for  grain  barge  transportation  on  the 
upper Mississippi River. They specified a model in which the dependent variable is the quantity of 
barge grain service. The independent variables included grain barge rate, grain exports, the domestic 
grain demand and supply, a rate proxy for the price of other modes, weather and seasonal dummy 
variables, and the quantity of barge grain service, lagged one period.

The authors estimated the equation in OLS and 2SLS. In the OLS estimates, the barge rate 
had the expected negative sign and was statistically significant. Grain exports had the expected 
positive sign and were significant. Neither the domestic grain demand nor supply was significant.  
The same was true for rail rates to the PNW from Minnesota and ocean freight rates. However, the 
rail rate from Minnesota to upper Mississippi River elevators had the expected negative sign and 

38

Railroad Demand Modelwas statistically significant. The weather and seasonal dummies had the expected sign and were 
significant.

The 2SLS estimates of the coefficients were worse than OLS. The barge rate elasticity increased 
but was more non-significant. Grain exports continued to be significant, but the regional grain stock 
variable as well as total domestic corn consumption were not significant. The rates for other transport 
modes were also non-significant. Thus grain exports, winter season, and the flood dummy are the 
only unlagged statistically significant variables influencing barge demand.

The  authors  concluded  that  the  short-run  own-price  elasticity  is  -0.479  while  the  long-run 
elasticity is -1.015. In summary, the authors found that barge demand on the upper Mississippi is 
influenced by barge rates, grain exports, the rail rate for Minnesota-originated grain shipped on the 
Mississippi River, winter season, and floods.

Train and Wilson (2007) focus on the access that shippers have to transportation markets.  They 
estimate  a  discrete  choice  model  framed  around  the  access  shippers  have  to  transport  markets, 
and they use the model to aggregate shipment decisions to provide spatially generated transport 
demands. The choice model results are combined with models of access cost (truck rates) over 
distance and aggregated to form demand functions.

In applying the model, two alternatives (barge or rail) for each shipper are used.  The connection 
to barge and/or rail facilities is treated as an access cost. The shipper selects the alternative that 
maximizes profits, which are a function of barge and rail rates, access costs (measured by truck 
costs), and railcar loading capacity (number of railcars that can be placed on the shippers’ siding).  
The model is estimated with a logit specification and the method of maximum likelihood.

The estimated model has a good fit, and the variables have the theoretically expected sign and 
are statistically significant. The results are that as the rate for barge or rail rises, profits of using the 
higher cost mode decline. Also, as the cost of trucking to a barge or rail terminal rise, profits fall, and 
the probability of using barge or rail falls. Profits for shippers that have greater car loading capacities 
have higher profits from rail relative to barge.

For an excellent discussion of the types of freight demand models as well as empirical findings 

and public policy applications see Small and Winston (1999).

THEORETICAL MODEL

As indicated by Train and Wilson (2007), the demand for freight transportation has historically taken 
two alternative approaches. Early studies modeled aggregate demands using aggregate data across 
locations and commodities. More recently, emphasis has shifted to modeling transport demands at a 
disaggregate level where transport demands are modeled at a shipment level using choice methods.  
We use an alternative approach developed by Yu and Fuller (2005).

Theory of Transport Demand

The demand for agricultural grain rail service is a derived demand. Therefore, factors that shift 
grain  supply  and  demand  in  production  regions  and  export  demand  will  shift  the  demand  for 
rail transportation (Boyer 1997). A two-region spatial equilibrium model is used to illustrate the 
theoretical foundation of grain railroad demand.

Panel A depicts the supply (Sx ) and demand (Dx ) of grain in production regions, while Panel 
C represents the rest of the world’s (ROW) demand (Dm ) and supply (Sm ) for grain as reflected 
at U.S. export ports.  Panel B is the trade panel, which includes the excess grain supply of grain 
production regions (ESx = Sx - Dx ) and the excess demand of the ROW that buy grain at U.S. 
export  ports  (EDm  =  Dm  -  Sm ).    The  intersection  of  excess  supply  (ESx)  and  excess  demand 
(EDm ) determines the equilibrium price and quantity of grain traded between production regions 
and export ports if no transportation costs were required to link the production regions to the ports. 

39

JTRF Volume 53 No. 1, Spring 2014Of course, transportation costs are very important in the marketing of grain. The derived demand 
for grain transportation and the supply of grain transportation service are depicted in Panel D.  The 
derived transportation demand is equal to the vertical distance between the excess supply (ESx ) and 
the excess demand (EDm ) in Panel B.  Also in Panel D is the supply of transportation service linking 
grain production regions with export ports. In 2010, railroads transported 68% of the combined 
railroad and barge tonnage of corn, wheat, and soybeans (AAR 2010). Thus, it is reasonable to 
assume that the supply is an approximation of the railcar fleet operating on the U.S. railroad system 
and the barge fleet operating on the inland waterways.  The intersection of derived transport demand 
and supply determines the transportation rate (Pt ) linking grain production regions to export ports.  
The corresponding grain prices are Px in Panel A for the grain production regions, and Pm in Panel 
B for ports, where grain prices in the two regions (Px and Pm ) differ by the transport rate (Pt ) that 
links the two areas.

Figure 1: Two-Region Spatial Equilibrium Model and Derived Transportation Market

Any variable that shifts the regional supply (Sx ) and demand (Dx ) of grain in the production 
regions will also shift the excess supply (ESx) and the derived transport demand. Similarly, any 
variable that shifts the ROW excess grain demand and supply will alter the derived demand for rail 
transport. We use actual grain production, which embodies the demand (both domestic and foreign) 
and supply shifting factors in grain markets as a regressor in the grain rail demand specification to 
capture the derived demand nature of rail transport. 

In  addition  to  the  economic  factors  identified  in  the  partial  equilibrium  case  in  Figure  1, 
other  transport  modes  may  compete  with,  as  well  as  complement,  grain  railroad  transportation.  
For example, much of the grain is delivered by truck to rail transloading locations, resulting in a 
complementary relationship. Railroads compete with barge transport in the coal, grain, ores and 
chemical markets.

Grain	Tonnage	Transported	by	Railijt	=	f	(Rail	Priceijt ,	Grain	Productionijt ,	Barge	Ratest	,	ηi ,	λj ,	τt )

i – commodity which includes wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans

Railroad prices (rates) should be included as an explanatory variable. According to the law of 
demand, an inverse relationship exists between rail demand and rate. That is, an increase in grain 
rail rate will reduce grain rail demand.  

As mentioned previously, Grain	Production, which embodies the demand (both domestic and 
foreign) and supply shifting factors in grain markets, is used as a regressor in the grain rail demand 
specification to capture the derived demand nature of rail transport.  Grain production is expected to 
affect the derived rail transport demand in a positive manner.

The prices of alternative modes would also impact rail grain demand. The principal substitute 
mode for railroads in the grain markets is barge transport. An increase in barge rates would increase 
rail grain demand as shippers switch to relatively lower priced rail service.  

Last, ηi controls for determinants of rail demand that are commodity-specific and unobserved to 
the researchers; λj controls for determinants of rail demand that are region-specific and unobserved 
to  the  researchers;  and  τt  controls  for  determinants  of  rail  demand  that  are  time-specific  and 
unobserved to the researchers.

DATA

Data for railroad tonnage of corn, wheat, sorghum, and soybeans for east and west regions, as well as 
data to compute rail price (revenue per originated ton), were obtained from various issues of Freight	
Commodity	Statistics published by the Association of American Railroads. Data for grain production 
of corn, wheat, sorghum, and soybeans were obtained from various issues of Agricultural	Statistics 
published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Barge rates were obtained from personnel at the 
Agriculture Marketing Service (AMS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Data for the variables 
in the equation were collected for the 1965-2011 period. The AMS surveys barge companies on a 
weekly basis to obtain grain barge rates.

The barge industry uses percent of tariff as rate units for buying and selling barge services.  
These rate units are from the Bulk Grain and Grain Products Freight Tariff No. 7, which was used 
by the Waterways Freight Bureau of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).  In 1976, the U.S. 
Department of Justice entered into an agreement with the ICC that made Tariff No. 7 no longer 
applicable, but the barge industry continues to use it as a benchmark. For example, Tariff No. 7 
(1976) has a grain barge rate of $4.04 per ton for the lower Ohio River.  If the current rate is 200% 
of tariff, then the rate is $8.08 per ton (2.0 x $4.04 = $8.08).

Figure 2 plots the volumes (measured in thousands of tons) of agriculture grains transported 
by rail over the time span of the data set. The figure shows that for much of the time period, corn 
is transported by rail in greater volumes compared with the other three commodities. In contrast, 
for almost all the time period, sorghum is transported by rail in smaller volumes compared with 
the other three commodities.  In addition, 28,446.20 thousand tons of corn, 9,782.20 thousand tons 
of soybeans, and 39,686 thousand tons of wheat were transported by rail in 1965, compared with 
73,322.70 thousand tons of corn, 22,243.10 thousand tons of soybeans, and 44,460.50 thousand tons 
of wheat in 2011, respectively.  Therefore, over the sample period, the volumes of corn, soybeans, 

41

JTRF Volume 53 No. 1, Spring 2014and wheat that are transported by rail grew by 157.75%, 127.38%, and 12.03%, respectively. In 
contrast, 9,498.80 thousand tons of sorghum was transported by rail in 1965, compared with only 
1,918.70 thousand tons in 2011, resulting in a 79.80% decline. In summary, over the sample period, 
corn was transported by rail in greater volumes and showed the largest growth compared with the 
other three commodities, while sorghum was transported by rail in the smallest volumes and these 
volumes actually declined.

Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the dependent, independent, and instrument variables 
used in estimating the agricultural grain railroad demand model. The table reports each variable’s 
mean, standard error, number of observations, minimum value, and maximum value. The sample 
means for all variables are statistically different from zero at the 1% level of statistical significance.  
In terms of mean tons of each commodity transported by rail over the sample period, we see that 
corn has the largest mean tonnage of rail transport followed by wheat, soybeans, and sorghum, 
respectively. 

Rail revenue per ton is the measure we use for rail price. The mean rail price to transport wheat 
is  highest  ($17.14  per  ton)  followed  by  the  mean  rail  price  for  corn  ($14.87  per  ton),  sorghum 
($14.66 per ton), and soybeans ($13.29 per ton), respectively.  As previously discussed, the demand 
for rail transport coming from producers of grain is derived from the volume of grain produced that 
needs to be transported.  Mean grain production is largest for corn (7,970,880 thousand bushels) 
followed by mean production of soybeans (2,079,755 thousand bushels), wheat (2,076,975 thousand 
bushels), and sorghum (636,632.40 thousand bushels), respectively.

Grain is also transported by barge.  As such, changes in the relative price to transport by barge, 
measured by the Barge Rates variable, should influence the demand for rail transport.  Barge rates 
are measured by the grain spot barge price as a percent of tariff.  Mean barge rate is 214.38%, and it 
ranges from a low of 117% to a high of 494%.

Railroad Demand ModelThree variables that were used as instruments for rail price when estimating demand: Railroad 
Labor Cost, Railroad Diesel Fuel Price, and Number of Covered Hopper Railcars. These variables 
are all expected to influence the unit cost of providing rail transport and therefore capture rail supply-
shifting shocks to rail price.  Railroad labor cost is measured by earnings per employee per year in 
dollars.  Mean annual earnings per employee is $37,734.20.  Railroad diesel fuel price has a mean 
73.79 cents per gallon, and the mean number of covered hopper railcars is 293,824.2.

The demand model estimates are reported in Table 2. We begin by estimating the demand model 
without using instruments for railroad price, i.e., we first use ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate 
the demand equation parameters.3  These model estimates are reported in the columns labeled OLS.  
We then re-estimate the demand equation parameters using instruments for price via Generalized 
Methods of Moments (GMM) estimation. The substantial difference in the size of the OLS and 
GMM coefficient estimates on rail price suggests that rail price is endogenous.  The endogeneity of 
rail price is confirmed using a formal statistical test of endogeneity, which is reported in the third-to-
last row of Table 2. The statistical test is distributed Chi-square under the null hypothesis (Ho) that 
rail price is exogenous. Given that the probability value for the Chi-square statistic is 0.0035, which 
is less than 0.05, then we reject that rail price is exogenous at the 5% level of statistical significance.  
An overidentification test, reported in the second-to-last row of Table 2, is used to help evaluate 
the validity of instruments used in the GMM estimation. A criterion for validity of instruments is 
that they are uncorrelated with the residuals of the model. The overidentification test is distributed 
Chi-square under the null hypothesis that instruments are uncorrelated with residuals of the model.  
Given that the probability value of the Chi-square statistic is 0.837, which is greater than 0.05, then 
we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are uncorrelated with the residuals at the 
5% level of statistical significance. In other words, the instruments are orthogonal to the residuals 
of the demand model.  

Another criterion for validity of instruments is that they are correlated with the endogenous 
regressor, i.e., valid instruments should be correlated with rail price. The weak instruments test, 
reported in the last column of Table 2, is used to evaluate the validity of instruments based on this 
criterion.  The weak instrument test is distributed F under the null hypothesis that instruments jointly 
cannot explain variations in rail price. Given that the probability value for the F-statistic is 0.000, 
which is less than 0.05, we then reject this null hypothesis at the 5% level of statistical significance.  
Therefore, the instruments pass the weak instruments test, revealing that the instruments have a joint 
statistically significant effect on rail price.

In summary, both standard demand-supply equilibrium theory and diagnostic statistical tests 
suggest that rail price is endogenous in the regression model. Furthermore, the diagnostic statistical 
tests discussed above suggest that the instruments we use to deal with the endogeneity problem are 
valid and effective. Therefore, the remainder of the discussion focuses on the GMM estimates.

Since both dependent and independent variables are in their logarithm form when estimating 
the model, coefficient estimates are interpreted as elasticities. The own-price elasticity estimate of 
grain demand for rail transport has the theoretically correct sign and is estimated to be -1.228.  This 
own-price elasticity estimate is statistically significant at the 1% level of statistical significance.

The coefficient on Grain Production is 0.956, suggesting that a 1% increase in grain production 
increases rail demand by 0.956%. This rail derived demand effect is statistically significant at the 
1%  level  of  statistical  significance. The  positive  relationship  between  grain  production  and  rail 
demand agrees with theoretical expectations.

The  coefficient  estimate  on  Barge  Rates  is  positive  and  statistically  significant,  suggesting 
that barge transport of grain is predominantly a substitute for rail transport. The 0.484 coefficient 
estimate suggests that a 1% increase in barge rates will increase railroad grain demand by 0.484%.

Notes:  ***  indicates  statistical  significance  at  the  1%  level,  **  indicates  statistical  significance  at  the  5% 
level, while * indicates statistical significance at the 10% level. Regressions are estimated using the logarithm 
of  dependent  and  all  continuous  right-hand-side  variables.    Therefore,  reported  coefficient  estimates  are 
interpreted as elasticities.

We include commodity fixed effects (captured by commodity zero-one dummy variables) to 
control for unobserved differences in the level of rail demand across different commodities.  The 
excluded  commodity  dummy  variable  is  corn.  Therefore,  the  coefficients  on  dummy  variables 
sorghum,  soybeans,  and  wheat  measure  these  commodities’  rail  demand  relative  to  corn  rail 
demand. The coefficient on the sorghum dummy is not statistically significant at conventional levels 
of statistical significance; suggesting that level of rail demand from sorghum producers that is not 
captured by the other control variables in the demand model is not statistically different from the 
level of rail demand from corn producers, ceteris	paribus. At first glance this result might seem 
surprising given the line plots of grain volumes transported by rail in Figure 2. Figure 2 revealed 
that substantially smaller tonnage of sorghum is transported by rail compared with tonnage of corn 
transported by rail. However, the regression results in Table 2 are simply suggesting that much of 
the rail transport volume difference across these two commodities displayed in Figure 2 can be 
explained by the control variables included in the demand model.

The  coefficient  estimate  on  the  soybean  dummy  is  -0.319  and  statistically  significant, 
suggesting that soybeans have a lower rail demand compared with corn, ceteris	paribus. In contrast, 

45

JTRF Volume 53 No. 1, Spring 2014the coefficient estimate on the wheat dummy is 1.039 and statistically significant, suggesting that 
wheat has a higher rail demand compared with corn, ceteris	paribus. So the coefficient estimates 
on the commodity dummies suggest that wheat has the highest rail demand that is not explained by 
regressors included in the demand model followed by corn, sorghum and soybeans, respectively.

The 0.676 coefficient estimate on the western region dummy variable suggests that grain rail 
demand  is  higher  in  the  western  region  of  the  United  States  compared  with  the  eastern  region.  
This regional rail demand difference is statistically significant at conventional levels of statistical 
significance.

Last, the coefficient estimate of 0.019 on the time trend variable suggests that grain rail demand, 
on average, grew annually by 1.9%, ceteris	paribus.   This annual growth in grain rail demand is 
statistically significant at 1% level of statistical significance.

CONCLUSION

The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 promoted a major restructuring of the U.S. Class I railroad industry.  
The number of Class I railroads fell from 40 in 1980 to seven today due to numerous mergers and 
consolidations. The Class I railroads reduced their costs as they abandoned branch lines or sold 
these lines to regional or local railroads. The Class I industry achieved tremendous increases in labor 
productivity, which contributed to improved financial condition. Despite the enormous changes in 
the Class I railroad industry, recent studies of railroad demand have been relatively few. This paper 
partially addressed this research gap by estimating the railroad demand for wheat, corn, sorghum, 
and soybeans for the United States as well as the east and west region. Railroads, grain exporters, 
grain marketing companies, and barge operators need estimates of railroad demand as an aid to 
strategic planning.

As opposed to utilizing an aggregate or disaggregate approach, this study used a two region 
spatial equilibrium model developed by Yu and Fuller (2005). The empirical model made grain 
tonnage transported by rail a function of rail price, grain production, barge rates, commodity and 
region fixed effects, and a time trend. The model was initially estimated with OLS. However, rail 
price  was  found  to  be  endogenous.  The  demand  equation  was  re-estimated  using  instrumental 
variables for price via the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation.

All the variables had the theoretically expected signs and were statistically significant at the 1% 
level (except sorghum).  The equation had a good fit with an R2 of 0.96.  The own-price elasticity of 
grain demand for rail transport was -1.23.  The barge rate elasticity was 0.48, confirming that barge 
transport of grain is a substitute for rail transport.

The coefficient of the soybean dummy was negative, suggesting that soybeans have a lower 
rail demand compared with corn. In contrast, the coefficient of the wheat dummy was positive, 
suggesting that wheat had a higher rail demand compared with corn. In summary, the coefficients 
of the commodity dummies suggest that wheat has the highest rail demand not explained by other 
variables in the model, followed by corn, sorghum, and soybeans, respectively.  Another contribution 
of the paper was the result that region has a differential effect on railroad grain demand, which is 
higher in the west region compared with the east.
