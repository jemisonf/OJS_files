Agricultural	and	other	shippers	are	concerned	about	the	sufficiency	in	rural	areas	of	transportation

INTRODUCTION

Railroad deregulation encouraged greater reliance on free markets to promote railroad profitability 
and public benefits (Grimm and Winston 2000).  The Staggers Act significantly reduced economic 
regulation in the railroad industry, which has benefited shippers as well as railroads, but relies on 
competition to protect shippers and the public.  

Since the Staggers Act, the average rate of return on investment for the railroad industry has 
increased from less than 2.5% during the 1970s to slightly more than 10% during 2006 and 2007 
(AAR 2008).  The return on equity for the railroad industry, when compared with revenue adequacy 
standards using STB’s Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM),1 has exceeded revenue adequacy2 levels 
from 2002 through 2006.  In addition, railroad industry earnings above CAPM revenue adequacy 
standards have widened from 2004 through 2006 (Christensen & Associates 2008).  However, when 
using the STB’s historical revenue adequacy standard, the Discounted Cash Flow model (DCF), the 
railroad industry did not appear to be revenue adequate (Christensen & Associates 2008).  

During the first decade after the Staggers Act, the annual benefits to shippers from railroad 
deregulation amounted to more than $12 billion in 1999 dollars, equivalent to $14.7 billion in 2007 
dollars (Grimm and Winston 2000).  Shippers have benefitted from 20 years of decreasing rail rates 
(in terms of inflation-adjusted revenue per ton-mile) and the preservation of rural lines sold or leased 
to smaller railroad firms.  Many of these new short line railroads have been able to operate profitably 
on rail lines abandoned by the major railroads, and have generally provided more individualized 
service to shippers (Babcock, Prater, Morrill, and Russell 1995). 

As expected, the distribution of benefits has tended to favor grain producers and shippers in 
regions with more transportation competition (Bitzan, Vachal, VanWechel, and Vinge 2003).  In 
addition, rates have not declined uniformly across commodities, and rates for some commodities are 
significantly higher than those for other commodities.  In particular, from 1987 to 2004, rail rates for 

111

Rail Competition Changes
grain have increased 9%, but rates have declined for coal, motor vehicles, and miscellaneous mixed 
shipments (GAO 2006).  

Despite the initial success of the Staggers Act, agricultural producers and shippers continue 
to express concern about decreased rail-to-rail competition, rapidly increasing rail rates, poor rail 
service, rail capacity constraints, and the fair allocation of rail capacity (NGFA 2005, USDA 2005).  
Because of these shipper concerns, Congress required USDA and USDOT in Section 6206 of the 
Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (PL 110-246) to submit a report on rural transportation 
issues. The basis for this paper comes from some of the analysis from that report (USDA/DOT 
2010).  

Current  Congressional  debate  includes  proposals  to  reform  railroad  regulation  because  of 
decreases in rail competition since 1980, which have increased the amount of railroad market power 
relative to that of shippers (USDA 2000).  Thus, a major purpose of this paper is to measure the 
level of rail competition for the transportation of grains and oilseeds in each crop reporting district 
(CRD). Two common ways of measuring changes in competition are the four-firm concentration 
ratio  and  the  use  of  a  Herfindahl-Hirschman  Index  (HHI). This  paper  examines  changes  in  the 
four-firm concentration ratio in the United States since 1980 and changes in the inverse HHI by 
CRD since 1985 and finds that the amount of rail-to-rail competition for the shipment of grain and 
oilseeds has decreased for both measures.

In addition, this paper compares nominal rail rates per ton and per ton-mile as well as revenue-
to-variable cost ratios of six states with limited rail-to-rail competition, and distant from barge-
loading facilities, with those of four states with more rail-to-rail competition and close proximity to 
barge-loading facilities.  

An affordable and reliable transportation network is necessary to maintain the strength and 
competitiveness  of American  agriculture  and  rural  communities.    Rail  service  is  a  particularly 
important part of that network for U.S. agriculture, because it is virtually the only cost-effective 
shipping alternative available for low-value, bulky commodities in rural areas that are distant from 
water transportation and markets. Therefore, examining the performance of the railroad system in 
agricultural movements is timely and policy relevant.  

Agricultural producers are dispersed over the entire country, and unlike most other industries, 
are unable to move their operations at will as their production is tied to the land, and often to a 
particular climate. Because agricultural production is tied to arable land, producers must be able to 
transport their products to markets, many of which are located long distances from the farms.  

Nine of the 10 top wheat-producing states are more than 150 miles from barge transportation on 
the Mississippi River, which usually provides the strongest intermodal competition to railroads for 
the long-distance movement of grain to export ports. Unlike other agricultural shippers in the United 
States, wheat shippers in much of the Great Plains have no cost-effective transportation alternatives 
to  railroads.   The  wheat  produced  in  these  areas  moves  long  distances  to  domestic  markets  for 
processing and consumption or to coastal ports for export. Shippers in these regions have little direct 
access  to  inland  waterway  transportation,  and  the  distances  involved  make  truck  transportation 
uneconomical. Consequently, wheat is particularly dependent on rail; 66% of all wheat and wheat 
exports moved by rail during 2007 (USDA 2010).   

Agricultural  shippers  in  Montana  and  North  Dakota  are  particularly  dependent  on  rail 
transportation because of their distance to inland waterways and the prohibitive distance for the use 
of trucks.  On average, railroads transported more than 70% of the grains and oilseeds originated in 
Montana and North Dakota during the crop marketing years from 2004 to 2007 (Figure 1). A study 
by Tolliver and Dybing (2007) revealed that during crop marketing year 2004, railroads transported 
78% of North Dakota crops.  Another recent study states that Montana ships nearly 100% its wheat 
by rail, which corresponds with USDA findings for Montana (Cutler, Goldstein, Fauth, Crowley, 
and Whiteside 2009).

During the crop marketing years 2004–2007, railroads transported more than 50% of the grain 
production of Arizona, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.  During the same time period, rail moved 

112

more than 30% of grain and oilseed production in the states of Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, 
Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Tennessee, and Washington.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Numerous studies discuss railroad industry competition and pricing, providing varying degrees of 
analysis as to the impact of competition within the agricultural industry. Many of these papers, 
which are regional in scope, investigate the impact of deregulation after the Staggers Rail Act of 
1980, with the majority written in the decade after enactment.  The following literature review is not 
a complete survey of the prior research related to railroad competition, but instead emphasizes the 
interaction between railroad competition and rail grain transportation prices.

Babcock, Sorenson, Chow, and Klindworth (1985) investigated the impact of the Staggers Act 
on Kansas agriculture.  The study found substantial railroad rate reductions in the four-year period 
of 1981 through 1984.  The pattern of rate changes suggested the presence of both intramodal and 
intermodal transportation competition.  Tariff rates to the Gulf of Mexico during this period dropped 
34%, compared with a 64% increase in the four years preceding the Staggers Act.

MacDonald (1987) used regression analysis of the 1983 waybill sample data to examine the rail 
rates for corn, wheat, and soybeans.  Tonnage, distance, and volume of the shipments were inversely 
related to rates.  In addition, increased intramodal competition, as depicted by the reciprocal of the 
Herfindahl Index, was inversely related to rates, and rail rates increased with distance to waterways.  
A later study (MacDonald 1989a) used waybill data from 1981 through 1985 to analyze rail 
rates and competition for corn, wheat, and soybeans.  MacDonald found that when rail service goes 
from a monopoly to a duopoly, rail rates decline 18%.  The addition of a third competing railroad 
resulted in an additional 11% decrease in rail rates.  In addition, shippers located 400 miles from 
barge access paid rail rates that were 40% higher than those located 100 miles from barge access.  

113

Rail Competition Changes
Finally, MacDonald calculated inverse Herfindahl-Hirschman indices for each CRD and concluded 
that each CRD was characterized by rail oligopolies.

Harbor (2008) found similar results for rail rates for soybeans.  Rail rates decreased 10.9% 
when moving from a monopoly to two-railroad competition in a market 300 miles from a barge-
loading facility.  Adding a third railroad decreased rates another 6.5%.  Furthermore, in the 12-state 
region studied, the average inverse HHI for corn had dropped to 1.86 in 2004 from 2.30 in 1983.  
The average inverse HHI for soybeans and wheat decreased from 2.46 in 1983 to 1.90 in 2004 and 
from 1.85 in 1983 to 1.58 in 2004, respectively.

Chow (1986) studied post-Staggers rail grain rates for the Central Plains region.  The analysis 
indicated an overall reduction in wheat rail rates of 34.5% in the five-year period after enactment of 
the Staggers Act, with the most significant reductions occurring in movements to the export markets.  
Kwon, Babcock, and Sorenson (1994) examined the impacts of the Staggers Act in the latter 
half of the 1980s and found that railroads practiced differential pricing for intra-Kansas and export 
shipments of wheat. There were substantial differences in the factors affecting the revenue-to-variable 
cost ratios for intra-Kansas wheat movements versus that of Kansas export wheat movements. They 
found revenue-to-variable cost ratios increased steadily from 1986 through 1989, but may have been 
caused by diminishing export demand.  

Fuller, Bessler, MacDonald, and Wohlgenant (1987) found deregulation to have had a significant 
effect on rail corridors linking Kansas and Texas with Gulf ports and a relatively modest effect on 
the corridor linking Indiana with East Coast ports.  Real rail rates declined $.37 per bushel in the 
Kansas corridor and $.31 per bushel in the Texas corridor during the 1981-1985 period.  In the 
Indiana corridor, estimated real rail rates decreased $.08 per bushel.  Railroad deregulation had little 
statistically significant effect on real rail rates from Iowa and Illinois to the Gulf ports.

Koo, Tolliver,  and  Bitzan  (1993)  examined  railroad  pricing  behavior  in  North  Dakota. The 
authors stated that the region has unique transportation characteristics that include limited intermodal 
competition  due  to  great  distances  to  barge-loading  facilities  and  to  major  domestic  and  export 
markets.  They found that distance, volume, weight per car, intramodal competition, and intermodal 
competition had significant negative effects on rail rates. 

Thompson,  Hauser,  and  Coughlin  (1990)  evaluated  the  pre-  and  post-Staggers  effect  of 
competition on railroad revenue-to-variable cost ratios for export shipments of corn and wheat. The 
regression results for corn rates were less significant than those for wheat rates. There was a lack 
of identifiable differences in pre- and post-Staggers pricing, which they felt may be attributable to 
the close correlation between changes in operating factors, such as shipment size and destination 
opportunity.  They concluded that their results did not indicate a clear effect of the Staggers Rail Act 
on rail rate competitiveness.

Wilson and Wilson (2001) examined rail rates per ton-mile for barley, corn, sorghum, wheat, 
and soybeans moved by rail. The explanatory variables include commodity ton-miles, commodity 
prices, average length of haul, and a non-linear specification of deregulation that allows the effects 
to phase in over time.  The results showed that commodity prices have positive effects on rail rates 
per ton-mile and length of haul has a strong negative effect.  The results indicated a large negative 
effect on rates per ton-mile from deregulation, which dissipate with time.

RAIL COMPETITION IN AN ERA OF DEREGULATION

This section discusses the deregulation of the railroad industry, the role of competition, and various 
types  of  competition  in  the  railroad  industry  today  to  establish  a  foundation  for  the  analysis  of 
changes in railroad competition for grain and oilseed transportation.

Deregulation of the Railroad Industry

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010

The constraints of pervasive economic regulation, although meant to protect shippers from the abuse 
of railroad market power, resulted in nearly bankrupting the railroad industry as well as increasing 
shipper costs. Furthermore, federal legislators recognized that industry regulation was expensive 
for both industry and government, and created market distortions for nearly all regulated markets 
(Hovenkamp  2005).  Congress  deregulated  railroads  in  response  to  arguments  that  the  industry 
needed greater pricing and operating freedom to avoid more bankruptcies (Meyer 1973).  

As the nation deregulated the railroad industry, conflicting goals included the preservation of 
effective transportation competition, the regulatory protection of captive shippers, deregulation of 
rail rates when sufficient competition is present, and revenue adequacy of railroad firms.

The concept of adequate competition is so important that competition is mentioned four times, 
avoidance of undue concentration of market power is mentioned once, and adequate railroad revenues 
or sound economic conditions is mentioned twice in the 15 Rail Transportation Policy goals of the 
Staggers Act and ICCTA (Public Law 104-88).  The presence of transportation competition was 
expected to protect most shippers by constraining the use of railroad market power.  On the other 
hand,  adequate  revenues  are  necessary  for  rail  service  to  remain  viable  and  continue  providing 
service.

In  cases  when  rail-to-rail  competition  is  not  present,  captive  shippers  need  meaningful  and 
cost-effective rate appeals processes to protect against the excessive use of railroad market power 
(GAO 1999, USDA 2004).  Until 2008, the only rail rate appeals used by shippers were Stand-Alone 
Cost procedures, which cost millions to adjudicate and involve the construction and operation of 
a hypothetical railroad (GAO 1999, USDA 2004, USDA and USDOT 2010).  Whereas a coal case 
typically involves the construction of a hypothetical railroad between a single origin and a single 
destination, a rate case for agricultural shippers would typically involve single or multiple origins to 
multiple destinations (USDA 2004).  Agricultural shippers in the Northern Plains appealed rail rates 
in the McCarty Farms case, but spent millions of dollars and lost on appeal after 16 years (USDA 
and USDOT 2010).  Thus, coal shippers are the main users of the Stand-Alone Cost procedures, 
which are considered far too expensive and complicated for agricultural shippers to use.  Indeed, an 
agricultural shipper would spend far more filing a Stand-Alone Cost rate appeal than the value of the 
case (USDA 2004, USDA and USDOT 2010).  

Even  though  Congress  had  required  small  rate  case  appeals  procedures  as  early  as  1986, 
small shippers essentially had no protection until 1996, when the STB first made small rate case 
appeals procedures available (USDA and USDOT 2010). Small shippers, however, did not use those 
procedures because they did not perceive them to be cost effective and were concerned about the 
uncertainty of the process (USDA 2004). The STB held a proceeding regarding small rate case 
appeals  procedures  and  set  new  rules  for  small  rate  case  appeals  in  2008.  Although  chemical 
shippers (i.e., E.I. Dupont v. CSX Transportation) have successfully used these procedures, so far 
no  agricultural  shipper  has  appealed  rail  rates  under  these  new  appeals  procedures  (USDA  and 
USDOT 2010).

Role of Competition

Some  economists  claim  that  the  way  to  preserve  and  extend  the  benefits  of  deregulation  is  to 
increase  rail  competition  (Grimm  2004).    Many  shipper  groups  have  echoed  this  conclusion  in 
comments prepared for various proceedings before the Surface Transportation Board. Market-based 
competition is a fundamental economic policy of the United States (National Commission 1979). 
Competition requires businesses to become efficient and effective in providing the kinds and quality 
of goods and services the consumer desires.3 Competitive markets reduce market distortions and 
result in the efficient allocation of resources, providing a basis for economic development. “The 
U.S. economy is an example of how free markets can lead to the creation of wealth, making possible 

115

Rail Competition Changes
improved living standards and greater prosperity (Lewis 2004).” Furthermore, industries sheltered 
from competition are less vigorous and successful than industries subject to competition (Porter 
1990).  

When economic regulation is imposed on an industry, competition is not as important because 
government protects the consumer and social welfare (Kahn 1998).  When an industry is deregulated, 
however, competition and antitrust enforcement become the major forces protecting the consumer 
and society from unfair business practices (Kahn 1998).  The loss of competition, combined with 
deregulation, could lead to the unrestrained use of market power (Kahn 1998).  This is especially 
true in highly concentrated industries that possess market power, such as the railroad industry (Kahn 
1998).  Unrestrained use of railroad market power would likely result in unnecessarily high rail 
rates and the inability of agricultural producers to reach multiple and competing markets.  Because 
agricultural producers typically receive a price net of transportation, higher rail rates and inability 
to access a variety of markets result in reduced producer income. The preservation and protection of 
competition is vital for the economic prosperity of agricultural producers and shippers contending 
with a mostly deregulated railroad industry.  

Effective Competition

In order for competition to be effective, it must be cost competitive.  Four types of competition can 
constrain the use of railroad market power (Tye 1991, STB 1998): 

•	

Intermodal competition from other transportation modes, such as motor carrier, multimodal, 
and barge transportation
Intramodal (rail-to-rail) competition among individual, independent railroads

•	
•	 Geographic competition, in which a producer can haul products to rail loading facilities 
located  on  competing  railroads  or  in  which  a  buyer  could  obtain  products  from  other 
originating locations

•	 Product competition, in which a producer can substitute other inputs in the manufacture 

of a product 

Barges, railroads, and trucks not only compete against each other, they also complement each 
other.    Before  agricultural  products  reach  the  market,  they  have  often  been  transported  by  two 
or more transportation modes. This balance between competition and complementaries provides 
agricultural shippers with a highly efficient, low-cost system of transportation (USDA 2006). 

Decreased rail-to-rail competition among Class I railroads has resulted in an increased ability 
of railroads to raise rates. The presence of a competing railroad has a noticeable effect on rail rates.  
Rail rates rise well above incremental costs in regions with one or two railroads and are far removed 
from navigable rivers (MacDonald 1989b).  

Although product and geographic competition can limit railroad pricing in some cases, these 
forms of competition are less relevant to market dominance today in light of the rapid consolidation 
of the rail industry (STB 1998). 

The average number of route miles operated by each of the Class I railroads in the United States 
has more than tripled since 1980, resulting in dominance over larger geographic regions by a single 
Class  I  railroad.    Railroad  mergers  of  the  1960s  and  1970s  combined  smaller  rail  systems  that 
operated in smaller geographic territories. In the 1980s, newly merged rail systems began to gain 
dominance within some geographic regions. For instance, in 1960, the average Class I railroad in the 
United States operated 1,956 route miles. By 1980, this had increased to 4,226 miles, and by 2007, 
to 13,473 miles (AAR Ten-Year Trends various editions).  

As a result, many farmers in the Plains States no longer have a cost-effective option of hauling 
grain to an elevator served by a competing railroad.  In 1980, the ability of a farmer to haul grain to 
an elevator served by a competing railroad often provided the competition necessary to constrain 
rail rates.  Today, only two Class I railroads are dominant in the western United States and two are 

116

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010
dominant in the eastern United States. This decrease in rail-to-rail competition has decreased the 
effectiveness and the relevance of geographic and product competition (USDA 1998).  

RAILROAD CONCENTRATION AND MARKET SHARES 

Since the 1920s, many railroads have merged.  During the 1960s and 1970s, many of the mergers 
combined financially weak railroads with stronger firms in the hope of developing a financially 
stable railroad that was large enough to compete effectively with other transportation modes.  After 
deregulation, the pace of merger activity picked up as railroads strove to increase geographic range, 
eliminate duplicate lines, reduce costs by increasing the size of the firm, and gain increased market 
power.  

Many at the time of enactment of the Staggers Act did not foresee the extent of the loss of 
rail-to-rail  competition  because  of  rail  mergers,  which  has  resulted  in  increased  market  power.  
Many economists, however, anticipated the rationalization of the rail network because the regulated 
railroad industry was characterized by over-capacity. Consequently, reduction in excess capacity 
was a logical and expected result of deregulation. The concentration of increased tonnage on fewer 
track miles has enabled railroads to reap enormous economies of scale.  Rail costs have fallen 60% 
in real terms, and most of these savings have been passed on to shippers (STB 2009).

Today there are two major duopolies—one serving the western United States and the other 
serving the East.  In addition to these four mega railroads, during 2007 there were three smaller 
Class  I  railroads  serving  the  central  portion  of  the  nation,  33  regional  railroads,  and  523  local 
railroads (AAR 2008).  

Market Concentration and Share

The top four Class I railroads originated 84% of grain and oilseed traffic in 2007, compared with 
only 53% in 1980 (see Figures 2 and 3). In addition, the market share of the predecessor railroads 
compared with the current railroads has changed. Whereas the Burlington Northern and Atchison, 
Topeka  &  Santa  Fe  combined  for  only  30%  of  the  grain  and  oilseeds  originations  in  1980,  by 
2007 the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) had 42% of the market. This compares with a 31% 
market share held by Chicago & Northwestern, Union Pacific, and Missouri Pacific in 1980 that has 
decreased to only 19% for Union Pacific (UP) in 2007.

Rail Competition Changes

Railroad concentration and market shares are even higher for specific markets.  For instance, 
the top four Class I railroads transported 94% of the wheat in 2007 compared with only 80% in 1994 
(see Figures 4 and 5).  The market share for BNSF increased in comparison to its predecessors—54% 
in 2007 compared with 41% in 1994.  UP market share in 2007 was only 20% in 2007 compared 
with 29% for its predecessors in 1994.  The Soo (Canadian Pacific U.S.) market share increased to 
11% in 2007 from only 4% in 1994, while the CSX market share increased to 9% compared with 
only 4% for its predecessors.

However, the level of rail-to-rail competition is not a function of the market concentration of railroads 
in the nation as a whole.  Instead, it is a function of the quality and effectiveness of competitive 
options in particular markets.  It is not only the number of competing railroads to which shippers or 
receivers have access, but also the effectiveness of competition from the other transportation modes.  

INVERSE HERFINDAHL-HIRSCHMAN ANALYSIS OF RAIL-TO-RAIL 
COMPETITION 

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a commonly accepted measure of market concentration.   
It estimates the ability of a firm to use market power.  An HHI value, however, does not measure 
the actual use of market power.  The HHI takes into account the relative size and distribution of 
the firms in a market and approaches zero when a market consists of a large number of firms of 
relatively equal size.  It increases both as the number of firms in the market decreases and as the 
disparity in size among those firms increases.

Markets in which the HHI is between 1,000 and 1,800 are considered moderately concentrated 
and those in which the HHI exceeds 1,800 are considered concentrated.  The maximum value of the 
HHI is 10,000, which occurs when one firm has a monopoly in the market.  According to the U.S. 
Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (1997), transactions that increase the HHI 
more than 100 points in concentrated markets raise antitrust concerns under the Horizontal Merger 
Guidelines.

An inverse HHI, calculated by dividing 10,000 by the HHI, is often used to measure railroad 
concentration.   The  advantage  of  an  inverse  HHI  is  that  it  is  easier  to  visualize  the  number  of 
equivalent railroads with equal market shares that are competing in the market.  

An inverse HHI is always one or greater.  An inverse HHI of 1.00 is the equivalent of only one 
railroad competing in the movement of a commodity.  An inverse HHI of 2.00 is the equivalent of 
two railroads competing, with each railroad moving half the tonnage.  An inverse HHI of 3.00 is 

118

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010
the equivalent of three railroads competing in the market, with each railroad moving a third of the 
tonnage.  

The value of an inverse HHI also can be barely above 1.01 even when multiple railroads are 
competing in a CRD, depending on the relative market share of each.  A market with two railroads, 
one of which carries 95% of the traffic, has an inverse HHI of 1.10.  The value of the inverse HHI 
for a market with two railroads can range from 1.01 to 2.00.  Likewise, the inverse HHI for a market 
with three competing railroads can range from 1.01 to 3.00. 

Key Differences in This Analysis

This study has two major differences from the two recent studies by GAO (2006) and Laurits R. 
Christensen Associates, Inc. (2008) that used HHI to analyze railroad concentration and rates in 
markets.  

Only the tariff rates have been used for revenue calculations because the STB has no jurisdiction 
over contract rates. The STB has jurisdiction only on tariff rates having a revenue-to-variable cost 
ratio of 180% or more.  In addition, the actual contract rail rates are not shown in the Confidential 
Waybill  Sample.  Therefore,  tariff  rates  were  separated  from  contract  rates  using  a  “Contract 
Flag” field that STB provided to supplement the Confidential Waybill Sample.  Due to contract 
confidentiality  concerns,  STB  has  provided  the  Unmasked  Confidential  Waybill  Sample,  which 
contains the actual contract rates, for only very few studies (i.e., Christensen and Associates [2008], 
GAO [2006]). Many other studies examining railroad revenues and rates were not able to remove 
the bogus contract rates because the contract field flag is not available in the Public Waybill Sample.  
When calculating the tonnages for use in the inverse HHIs, data from all movements were used.  

Other studies used similar methods to calculate the inverse HHIs.    

The  second  major  difference  in  this  study  is  that  tonnages  originated  on  smaller  railroads 
connecting to only one other railroad were considered as part of the connecting railroad. This gives 
a more accurate portrayal of actual market share controlled by each railroad. When smaller railroads 
connected to two or more railroads, no attempt was made to assign the smaller railroads’ volumes to 
a particular railroad.  This is because little industry data are available regarding which railroads have 
contractual interchange commitments that may or may not strictly limit their ability to interchange 
with other railroads.  

This study split the period from 1985 to 2007 into three multi-year time periods (periods were 
chosen to reflect structural changes in the industry) rather than using data for single years.  This was 
done to obtain more CRDs having more than 30 observations, below which no results were reported 
for the CRD.  The three periods include:  

•	 Period 1: 1985–1992, an eight-year period representing the early years of deregulation, and 

including some important railroad mergers.  

•	 Period 2: 1993–2002, 10 years that saw many mergers and the formation of the Eastern and 
Western railroad duopolies.  Important operational issues arose during the implementation 
of these mergers.  

•	 Period 3: 2003–2007, five years in which capacity constraints on the rail system first ap-
peared, when the early retirement of engineers and conductors caused operational prob-
lems, and disruptions caused by storms were unusually severe.  Major increases in rail rates 
due to capacity constraints and high fuel costs also occurred during this period.

An inverse HHI for originated tonnage by CRD was calculated and mapped for four major 

commodity groups:  

•	 Grain and oilseeds
•	 Grain products including dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS)
•	 Food products excluding grain products and DDGS
•	 Fertilizers

Rail Competition Changes
Analysis of Inverse HHI and Revenue-to-Variable Cost Ratio

As  rail-to-rail  competition  decreases  in  a  CRD,  the  market  power  of  the  railroads  increases. A 
decrease in competition could result in higher rail rates and could give railroads the market power 
to change service terms.  The revenue-to-variable cost ratio is an indicator of that market power.

The first part of this study used inverse HHIs to measure the degree of rail-to-rail competition 
in each CRD.  The absolute value of the inverse HHIs and the degree of change are both important 
to an understanding of competitive status.  

Inverse HHI Analysis  

A markedly decreasing trend in rail-to-rail competition for shippers of the four product groups was 
found; many of the CRDs having higher inverse HHIs during Period 1 (1985 to 1992) moved to 
lower inverse HHIs by Period 3 (2003 to 2007) (see Table 1).  The level of rail-to-rail competition 
for grain and oilseeds shippers decreased in 109 CRDs, and only 38 CRDs had an increase in rail-to-
rail competition.  The percentage of CRDs having a decrease in the level of rail-to-rail competition 
for the other three product groups ranged from 67% to 76%, which is similar to that of grains and 
oilseeds.  

Revenue-to-variable cost ratios (R/VC) for all product groups shifted into the higher R/VC 
ranges. For grains and oilseeds, 108 CRDs (83%) had an increase in the R/VC ratio, but only 22 
(17%) had a decrease.  The percentage of CRDs experiencing increases in the R/VC ranged from 
77% for food products to 83% for grain and oilseeds. The R/VC ratios were calculated by dividing 
the freight revenue field in the Confidential Waybill Sample by the variable cost field.

The percentage of CRDs in which a railroad had a monopoly (inverse HHI equal to 1.00) for all 
product groups increased between Period 1 and Period 3. For grain and oilseeds, the number of 
CRDs with a rail monopoly increased from 20 (10% of the total CRDs) in Period 1, to 25 (15%) in 
Period 3. Eleven CRDs in this group of 20 had a change in the inverse HHI and nine had no change. 
Only two CRDs had an increase in competition since Period 1; one had an increase of 0.09 and the 
other had an increase of 0.80.4

R/VC Ratio Analysis  

Increased  competition  is  expected  to  result  in  lower  rail  rates. The  percentage  of  CRDs  having 
average R/VC ratios below 180 increases as the level of rail competition increases during periods 
1 and 3 (Table 2). For example, during Period 3, only 50% of the CRDs that were served by a rail 
monopoly had average R/VC ratios below 180. In contrast, during the same period, 93% of the 
CRDs had average R/VC ratios below 180 when more than four strong railroads were competing.  
The finding that increased competition results in lower rail rates is consistent with the conclusions 
of studies by MacDonald (1989) and Harbor (2008).

Rail Competition Changes
The number of railroads serving the grain and oilseeds market for each CRD is shown in Figures 6 
and 7.  Regions that changed to a rail monopoly since Period 1 include parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, 
Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, 
and Wyoming.  Many of the regions having inverse HHIs less than 2.0 are in areas of the country 
important in the production of grain and oilseeds and distant from barge-loading facilities.  

Figure 6: Inverse HHI for Grain and Oilseed Shipments by Rail, 2003-2007 

Figure 8 shows the changes in the inverse HHI by CRD.  Major grain production regions that have 
gained rail-to-rail competition since Period 1 include northeast Minnesota, central and eastern Iowa, 
and the Dallas/Fort Worth region of Texas.  CRDs that have lost the equivalent of 4.25 to 2.58 
competing railroads include west central Missouri, western Tennessee, north central Indiana, parts 
of Ohio, and a portion of Texas.  CRDs that have lost the equivalent of 1.41 to 2.58 competing 
railroads  since  Period  1  include  parts  of  Arkansas,  Colorado,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas, 
Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas. All of these states were in 
the top 20 U.S. grain- and oilseed-producing states during 2007.

Rail Competition Changes
Comparison of Rail-to-Rail Competition and Distance-to-Water Transportation by State

The study then examined annual statewide tariff rail rates from 1988 through 2007 for a group of 
six states with limited rail-to-rail competition and varying distances from barge-loading facilities, 
and a group of four states with more rail-to-rail competition and closer to barge loading facilities.  
States in the first group—with less rail-to-rail competition and varying distances from barge-
loading facilities—include Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado.  
The average distance to barge-loading facilities from the middle of these states ranges from 200 to 
850 miles.  For states showing a range of distances to water, the shorter distances are to facilities 
on the Missouri, Arkansas, Snake, or Illinois Rivers; the longer distances are to facilities on the 
Mississippi or Ohio Rivers (Table 3). Barge movements on the Missouri and Arkansas Rivers have 
fewer  cost  efficiencies  compared  with  rail  transportation;  barge  movements  on  the  Mississippi, 
Ohio, and Illinois rivers do realize cost efficiencies compared with rail. 

All these states produce large amounts of grain and oilseeds.  For instance, Nebraska is ranked 
third in the United States in grain and oilseed production, Kansas sixth, South Dakota seventh, 
North Dakota ninth, Colorado fourteenth, and Montana eighteenth.

Grain producers in Montana and North Dakota have raised issues for many years about high rail 
rates.  Rates in Montana and North Dakota have often been higher than for South Dakota, Nebraska, 
and  Kansas  grain,  even  though  the  grain  travels  shorter  distances  over  the  same  track  to  reach 
Pacific Northwest markets.  Montana and North Dakota have appropriated funds to study grain and 
oilseed rail rates and to appeal those rates to the STB.

The  states  with  more  rail-to-rail  competition  and  proximity  to  barge-loading  facilities  are 
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,  and Missouri. These states, also, are major grain and oilseed producers; 
Iowa is ranked first in the United States, Illinois second, Indiana fifth, and Missouri tenth.  All of 
these states border the Mississippi or Ohio rivers, and the Illinois River runs through Illinois.  The 
average distance from the middle of these states to barge-loading facilities is from 50 to 150 miles. 
The levels of intermodal and intramodal competition, average length of haul, and time are among 
the factors expected to affect revenue per ton and revenue per ton-mile.  The levels of intramodal 
and intermodal competition would be among the factors expected to affect the R/VC ratio.

In 1988, Montana and North Dakota paid the highest nominal (not adjusted for inflation) rail 
rates in the nation to move grain and oilseeds (see Table 3).5  Montana grain shippers paid $25.41 
per ton and North Dakota $22.61.  Kansas shippers paid only $11.69 and Nebraska $17.59.  The 
average rates for states with more transportation competition ranged from $9.06 to $12.12 per ton, 
but the average length of haul for those states was only 538 miles, compared with 994 miles for the 
states having less transportation competition.

By  2007,  however,  four  states  paid  more  to  ship  grain  than  shippers  in  Montana  ($27.70): 
Nebraska paid $30.07 per ton, South Dakota $29.64, North Dakota $28.89, and Iowa $28.28.  The 
average length of haul for the states paying more than Montana ranged from 1,150 to 1,710 miles 
(STB Waybill samples). Montana rates per ton had increased 8.3% and North Dakota 21.7% since 
1988, but the rate increase for the other eight states shown in Table 3 ranged from 30.4% (Colorado) 
to 67.1% (Iowa).  The greater shipping distances since 1988 for Iowa shippers contributed to the 
unusually large increase in their rate per ton (the average length of haul increased from 497 miles 
to  1,240  miles).    By  2007,  the  average  length  of  haul  for  the  states  having  less  transportation 
competition had increased to 1,198 miles, compared with only 845 miles for states having more 
transportation competition (STB Waybill samples).

Nominal tariff rates per ton-mile show that states lacking transportation competition do not 
always  pay  higher  rates  than  states  having  more  transportation  competition;  both  transportation 
competition and length of haul are expected to be negatively related to the rate per ton-mile.  In 
1988, Montana (987 miles) and North Dakota (1,150 miles) paid the highest nominal tariff rates per 
ton-mile, but Illinois (460 miles), Indiana (561 miles), Kansas (612 miles), and Missouri (635 miles) 
paid the next highest rates (see Table 3).  By 2007, Indiana (674 miles) paid the highest tariff rates

per ton-mile, followed by Montana (930 miles), Colorado (1,056 miles), and Kansas (852 miles) 
(STB Waybill samples).  The states having the least increase in tariff rates per ton-mile include 
North Dakota (with a 0.10 cent decrease), Illinois, South Dakota, Iowa, and Montana.  Colorado, 
Kansas, and Indiana had the steepest increases.  

An analysis of R/VC ratios based on tariff rates, which indicate the profitability of a movement 
for the railroads, shows mixed results relative to the amount of transportation competition.  In 1988, 
Montana and North Dakota grain shippers had the highest R/VC ratios, at 186 and 166.  The R/VC 
ratio for Montana was nearly 40% higher than it was for Iowa, which had the third highest R/VC 
rate among the 10 states selected for comparison (see Table 3).  In 2007, North Dakota and Montana 
grain  shippers  still  paid  the  highest  R/VC  ratio,  and  Kansas,  Iowa,  and  Colorado  paid  the  next 
highest ratios.  In 2007, however, the Montana R/VC ratio was only 10% higher than Iowa’s.  The 
R/VC ratio for Montana increased 0.5% and North Dakota’s 13% between 1988 and 2007.  The R/
VC ratio for Missouri increased 33%, that of Kansas 34%, and that of Nebraska 27%.  

The  use  of  statewide  averages  may  have  masked  the  relationship  between  transportation 
competition and R/VC.  Prior studies by McDonald (1989a) and Harbor (2008), which are based 
upon individual waybills, show a relationship between rail-to-rail and intermodal competition and 
rail rates.  

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

An  affordable  and  reliable  transportation  network  is  necessary  to  maintain  the  strength  and 
competitiveness of American agriculture and rural communities. Agricultural commodities are often 
produced in large quantities at locations distant from domestic and international markets, making rail 
a natural and preferred choice of transportation.  Truck transportation is not cost-effective for many 
agricultural shippers, who are often located long distances from markets, and barge transportation 
is not an option for most.  Rail is the only cost-effective transportation mode broadly available for 
many agricultural producers.  Railroads transport nearly all of the grains and oilseeds produced in 
Montana, more than 70% of that produced in North Dakota, and more than 50% of that produced in 
Arizona, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.

Rail deregulation encouraged greater reliance on free markets to promote railroad profitability 
and  public  benefits,  but  relied  on  competition  to  protect  shippers  and  the  public. The  extent  of 
the loss of rail-to-rail competition due to railroad mergers, and the associated increase in market 
power, was not foreseen by many when the Staggers Act was passed. However, the abandonment 
of rail lines was a predictable outcome of railroad deregulation.  Railroads under regulation were 
burdened by significant excess capacity.  Deregulation permitted mergers and line abandonments, 
which eliminated overcapacity as a problem for railroads, and greatly increased railroad market 
power and profitability on remaining lines.  

The  preservation  of  competition  as  a  substitute  for  regulation  is  vital  for  the  economic 
prosperity of agricultural producers and shippers contending with a deregulated railroad industry.  
In deregulating the rail industry, however, Congress recognized that intermodal competition had the 
potential to be as effective as rail-to-rail competition in restraining the exercise of market power.  

Railroad  concentration  for  grains  and  oilseeds  shipments  has  increased  substantially  since 
1980 due to railroad consolidation and rail abandonment. The four-firm concentration ratio for U.S. 
railroad grain and oilseed traffic increased from 53% in 1980 to 84% in 2007. Market concentration 
is even greater for some individual commodities, such as wheat.  The four-firm concentration ratio 
for U.S. railroad wheat traffic increased from 80% in 1994 to 94% in 2007.

Inverse  HHI  analysis  shows  the  level  of  rail-to-rail  competition  for  grains  and  oilseeds 
decreased significantly between 1985 and 2007.  The number of competing lines decreased in 70% 
of the CRDs and increased in only 24%.  The CRDs served by only one railroad increased from 
10% in 1985 to 15% by 2007.  As rail-to-rail competition fell, rail rates rose.  The ratio of revenue 
to variable costs increased in 83% of the CRDs, but declined in only 17%.

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010
The percentage of CRDs having average R/VC ratios below 180 increases as the level of rail 
competition increases.  During period 3, only 50% of the CRDs that were served by a rail monopoly 
had average R/VC ratios below 180.  In contrast, during the same period, 93% of the CRDs had 
average R/VC ratios below 180 when more than four strong railroads were competing.

Many grain- and oilseed-producing regions that are distant from barge-loading facilities changed 
to rail monopolies after deregulation.  Many areas with less rail-to-rail competition are in regions 
important in the production of grain and oilseeds and are distant from barge-loading facilities.

Since  the  early  1990s,  portions  of  west  central  Missouri,  western  Tennessee,  north  central 
Indiana, parts of Ohio, and a portion of Texas have lost the equivalent of 4.25 to 2.58 competing 
railroads.    Parts  of  Arkansas,  Colorado,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas,  Kentucky,  Michigan, 
Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas have lost the equivalent of 1.41 to 2.58 competing 
railroads.  All were among the top-20 grain and oilseed producing states in 2007.  

This study also examined annual statewide tariff rail rates from 1988 through 2007 for a group 
of six states with limited rail-to-rail competition and varying distances from barge-loading facilities, 
and a group of four states with more rail-to-rail competition and closer to barge loading facilities.  
States  in  the  first  group  include  Montana,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Nebraska,  Kansas,  and 
Colorado.  States in the second group include Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri.

The levels of intramodal and intermodal competition, as well as length of haul, affect rail rates 
per ton.  In 1988, Montana and North Dakota shippers paid the highest nominal tariff rail rates in 
the nation to move grain and oilseeds.  By 2007, however, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, 
and Iowa all paid more to ship grain than Montana.  The average length of haul for the states paying 
more than Montana ranged from 1,150 to 1,710 miles.

Nominal  tariff  rates  per  ton-mile  show  that  states  lacking  rail-to-rail  competition  do  not 
necessarily  pay  higher  rates  than  states  with  more  transportation  competition;  both  the  level  of 
transportation competition and length of haul are expected to be negatively related to the rate per ton-
mile.  In addition, data analyzed at the state level can mask relationships that may be more apparent 
in analyses done at the CRD level.  Such possibilities warrant further research and examination.

An analysis of R/VC ratios based on tariff rates, which indicate the profitability of a movement 
for the railroads, showed that Montana and North Dakota grain shippers had the highest R/VC ratios 
during 1988 and 2007.  

Due to data limitations and time constraints, the authors were unable to do further analyses to 
examine more fully the relationship between rail-to-rail competition and R/VC ratios.  Analyses that 
are more exhaustive are required, such as the R/VC ratios presented in this study are an average of 
the R/VC ratios for movements by tariff rates only.  It is possible that some contract rail rates, which 
were not available for this analysis, are less than, are equal to or exceed the tariff rates in particular 
CRDs.   

Endnotes

1.  At the time of the Christensen study, the STB used the CAPM standard to evaluate the revenue 
adequacy of the railroad industry.  On January 28, 2009, STB adopted a new measure that is 
the simple average of the CAPM and a multi-stage discounted cash flow method of estimating 
revenue adequacy.  

2.  Simply stated, revenue adequacy is the ability of a firm to attract adequate capital in competitive 
capital markets.  Regulated firms are considered revenue adequate when the return on owners 
equity exceeds the calculated cost of equity capital.  

3.  USDA defines “efficient” as being cost-efficient; “effective” is the production of a product or 

service having the features and quality that consumers want.

4.  Not all CRDs are represented in both Period 1 and Period 3.  Thus, the numbers do not always 

tally.

5.  We did not adjust for inflation because we are comparing relative rates state to state and not 
trying to show whether real rates have gone up or down for each state.  We are looking at 
whether there are rate differences between states having more transportation competition and 
those having less transportation competition at the given points in time.
