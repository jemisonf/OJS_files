INTRODUCTION

This paper presents a human factors study that investigated the tailgating issues and possible means 
for  tailgating  treatment.  “Tailgating”  is  defined  as  following  a  vehicle  with  insufficient  vehicle 
headway  where  vehicle  headway  is  the  time  interval  that  the  two  consecutive  vehicles  passed 
the same reference point. Following with a vehicle headway less than two seconds is considered 
insufficient and unsafe (Hutchinson 2008). Tailgating is one of the most dangerous and aggressive 
driving behaviors, and is a major cause of rear-end crashes which resulted in 1.8 million incidents 
in the United States in 2006 (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 2008). To help reduce 
crashes caused by tailgating, effective tailgating treatments need to be found to advise drivers about 
maintaining proper vehicle headways. 

In this study, a vehicle headway analysis was first conducted to assess the tailgating situation 
on  Rhode  Island  highways.  It  next  surveyed  drivers’  opinions  regarding  the  causes  and  effects 
of  tailgating,  their  experiences  and  perceptions  on  tailgating  behavior,  and  their  preferences  for 
possible tailgating treatments consisting of advisory signs and road markings. Findings from the 
vehicle headway analysis and the survey lead into the next phase of the project where a driving 
simulation  experiment  is  developed  to  allow  a  real-time  test  on  drivers’  responses  to  different 
tailgating  treatments.  It  is  expected,  upon  completion  of  the  project,  that  an  effective  tailgating 
treatment system would be recommended to Rhode Island and other states. The findings of this 
project might interest practitioners in this field and possibly contribute to the development of a 
standard  tailgating  treatment  systems  to  be  included  in  the  Manual  on  Uniform Traffic  Control 
Devices (MUTCD). Ultimately, it could help ease the tailgating issues and facilitate safer driving 
on U.S. highways.

BACKGROUND

Reviews  of  literature  and  past  studies  involving  tailgating  issues  and  tailgating  treatments  are 
provided below.

Tailgating Issues

Tailgating is generally considered a form of aggressive driving (Teigen 2007). The National Highway 
Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA  2008)  defines  “aggressive  driving”  as  “an  individual 
committing a combination of moving traffic offenses so as to endanger other persons or property.”

Tailgating Issues
While many driving patterns are considered aggressive, tailgating is among the most dangerous 
ones and is a major cause of rear-end crashes.

Out of about 5.9 million police-reported automobile accidents in the United States during the 
year 2006, rear-end collisions ranked the highest, with more than 1.8 million cases (30.4%), and 
resulted in more than 2,100 fatalities and approximately 500,000 injuries (National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration 2008). Data from athe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) indicate 
that each year, approximately 2.2% of total licensed drivers in the United States are involved in rear-
end crashes (Singh 2003). Two factors are primarily responsible for rear-end crashes: inattention 
and tailgating (Dingus et al. 1997), while the latter is the major contributing cause with a deadly 
consequence (Carter et al. 1995).

Some past researchers showed that a wide range of factors such as drivers’  behavior, traffic 
condition, road condition, roadway design, state law and regulation, and even personality had effects 
on  vehicle  headway  (Ayres  et  al.  2001; Aycin  and  Benekohal  1998;  Brackstone  and  McDonald 
1999;  Hogema  1999;  Brackstone  2003;  Rajalin,  Hassel,  and  Summala  1997).  Based  on  these 
factors, various car following models were developed to describe the interaction between individual 
vehicles or the whole traffic dynamic. However, none of them compared these factors and identified 
factors that have major effects on vehicle headway.

While driving on highways, a driver’s reaction time varies from 0.5 second for simple situations 
to 4 seconds for complex situations and the reaction time in braking is about 2.5 seconds (American 
Association  of  State  Highway  Officials  [AASHO]  1973).  Green  (2000)  and  Summala  (2000) 
reported that simple reaction time was often less than one second while decision reaction time could 
take much longer. According to this, quantified safe following distance has been written into rules 
of the road. It varies from state to state, but is mostly in the form of a “two-second rule.” Drivers 
are advised to keep a vehicle headway of at least two seconds from the vehicle ahead driving in the 
same direction. Rear-end crash risk increases as vehicle headway decreases. When vehicle headway 
reduces to zero, a rear-end crash occurs.

Tailgating Treatments

Hutchinson (2008) conducted an in-depth investigation in Australia of rear-end crashes, tailgating, 
and the correlation between them. Calculations about how tailgating could lead to rear-end crashes 
were presented in his study and the results proved that a safe vehicle headway should be at least 
two seconds. Although he mentioned that inattention in various forms is a more frequent cause 
than  tailgating  as  shown  from  some  rear-end  crash  investigations,  inattention  could  naturally 
lead to tailgating. Measures to counter tailgating such as advisory signs, pavement markings, and 
enforcement by the police could help reduce rear-end crashes and were recommended in his study.
Rama and Kulmala (2000) conducted a field study in Finland and investigated the effects of 
two variable message signs (VMS) on drivers’ car-following behavior. The signs warned of slippery 
road conditions and to keep a minimum following distance. It was performed as a before-and-after 
experiment at three test sites. Results showed that the slippery road conditions sign reduced the 
mean speed by one-two km/hour in addition to the decrease caused by the adverse road conditions. 
The minimum following distance sign reduced the proportion of cars with following distance of less 
than 1.5 seconds, in addition to a speed reduction of one km/hour.

To help drivers gauge their following distances, research was conducted to assess the effects 
of regularly-spaced markings on highway pavement. Lertworawanich (2006, 2009) conducted a 
study to estimate safe car-following distance according to speed limit, and developed the “dot” 
treatment pavement markings. Headways in term of distance were examined before and after the 
implementation  of  “dot”  markings.  He  found  that  headways  were  increased  after  the  marking 
implementation at a given flow rate and the likelihood of rear-end collisions was reduced at the 
study site. Arrows spaced 131 feet apart, implying a gap of about three seconds at 60 miles per hour, 

70

were painted on a U.K. motorway in a study by Helliar-Symons, Webster, and Skinner (1995). They 
found that, because of the markings, crashes were reduced by 56% at the study site.

A few tailgating treatment programs were pilot-tested in several states such as Pennsylvania, 
Minnesota, and Maryland. PENNDOT’s Tailgating Treatment Program (Safety Improvements) was 
considered the most successful and was honored in 2001 with the National Highway Safety Award. 
On a portion of US Route 11 that previously experienced high rates of tailgating, aggressive driving 
and tailgating has dropped a significant 60% after equipping with reflective dots on the roadway, 
pavement  markings,  and  signs  that  help  motorists  gauge  their  distance  behind  moving  vehicles 
(Roadway  Safety  Foundation  2001).  Before  the  implementation,  there  were  135  crashes  a  year 
costing approximately $1.9 million. After the implementation, yearly crashes decreased to 60 at a 
reduced cost of $1.3 million. The cost of implementation in the first year is estimated at just over 
$11,000, including enforcement. After eight to nine months, statistics indicated that crash reductions 
remained fairly constant, pointing to the success of the program.

Given the successes, relatively low implementation cost, and the measurable benefits of the 
PENNDOT  program,  Minnesota  DOT  and  Public  Safety  piloted  a  similar  project  in  2006. The 
project was viewed as a tool to educate motorists on how to identify and maintain a minimum safe 
following distance, and to ultimately reduce rear-end crashes. Minnesota used similar engineering 
elements from the Pennsylvania program: elliptical pavement dots, informational signs, and a strong 
public information campaign. A section of State Highway 55 in Wright County was painted with 94 
elliptical dots, spaced 223 feet apart, along a two-mile single-lane segment of the rural roadway with 
a 55 mph speed limit. Vehicle headway data collected prior to and after the treatments showed that 
the average headway increased from 2.36 to 2.62 seconds, or 22.89 feet at the mid-point of the test 
site (Minnesota Department of Public Safety 2006). 

Michael, Leeming, and Dwyer (2000) implemented a method to collect tailgating data in an 
urban setting and assessed the effectiveness of two hand-held roadside signs admonishing drivers 
not to tailgate. One was “Please Don’t Tailgate” sign and the other “Help Prevent Crashes Please 
Don’t Tailgate.” Data collected from over 25,000 drivers were studied. They found that the latter 
had a significantly positive impact on drivers' tailgating behavior compared with the former sign, 
increasing the average headway by 0.18 seconds.

Advisory  signs  could  be  part  of  tailgating  treatments  to  help  mitigate  tailgating  behavior. 
However,  improper  use  of  advisory  message  signs  could  distract  drivers  and  cause  inattention 
leading to rear-end crashes. To reduce the risk of distracting drivers, the use of graphical images to 
convey the meaning on roadway signs has been employed in many European countries. It is found 
in many studies that graphically presented information allowed faster responses than information 
presented by words (Staplin, Lococo, and Sim 1990; Hanowski and Kantowitz 1997; Bruce, Boehm-
Davis, and Mahach 2000). Wang et al. (2007) conducted a pioneer study on the use of graphics on 
the dynamic message sign (DMS), a 1024x270 full matrix tri-color LED overhead message sign 
that is capable of displaying pre-programmed text and graphic messages. They found that most 
drivers preferred graphics over text and responded faster to graphic-aided messages than text-only 
messages. Due to these findings, proper graphics need to be designed and integrated into advisory 
signs in the development of feasible tailgating treatment systems. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY

Two approaches were employed in this study: a vehicle headway analysis to assess the tailgating 
situation on highways, and a questionnaire survey to find out the public’s perceptions on tailgating 
and their preferences on possible treatments. 

71

Tailgating Issues
Vehicle Headway Analysis

In this approach, traffic at three test sites on I-95, I-195, and I-295 in Rhode Island were analyzed. 
The study examined highway traffic surveillance videos that captured eight-lane traffic taken by 
three highway surveillance cameras on I-95 at Detroit Ave, I-195 at Rte. 114, and I-295 North at 
Exit 6 (see Figure 1).

Figure 1: Locations of Highway Traffic Surveillance Cameras

Videos taken during both rush hour and non-rush hour on weekdays during a two-week period 
in December 2008 were provided by Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT). Videos 
taken on weekdays between 7:30 and 8:00 am during rush hour and between 10:00 and 10:30 am 
during non-rush hour were analyzed. Three 5-minute segments were randomly selected from each 
of the 30-minute video clips in the analysis. To determine the vehicle headway for a vehicle, a 
reference line was drawn in the recorded scene, and based on the time stamp (in 1/100 second) 
embedded in the video, the time when the front bumper of a vehicle reaching the reference line was 
recorded. By calculating the time difference that two consecutive vehicles crossed the reference 
line, vehicle headway in hundredths of a second was determined for the following vehicle. Traffic 
volumes were also collected by counting all the vehicles that appeared in the surveillance videos 
during the randomly chosen 5-minute time intervals. The traffic volumes confirmed the selection of 
the time periods for rush hour and non-rush hour traffic.

All  vehicles  analyzed  were  classified  by  their  vehicle  headways  in  increments  of  seconds. 
Percentages of vehicles that broke the two-second rule, which means their headways were between 
zero and two seconds, were calculated. These vehicles were noted as tailgators. To find out if time 
of the day was a significant factor affecting tailgating, a hypotheses test using a paired t-test was 
employed to compare the tailgating situations (percentages of tailgators) between rush hour period 
and non-rush hour period on three test sites. The hypotheses are:

	

	 H0
	 H1
where  μd

	

 

 

= 0

: μd

= μrush hour – μnon-rush hour.

> 0

These analyses were further stratified by lane and bound (all lanes in the same direction) since 
all  three  highway  segments  were  eight-lane  highways  with  traffic  in  opposite  directions  (I-295 
South bound was not well captured by the highway surveillance camera, thus its data were missing 
in this study). 

72

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010
In  addition,  a  correlation  analysis  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  functional  relationship 
between tailgating and traffic volume. The percentages of tailgators at the randomly chosen time 
intervals during both rush hour and non-rush hour were regressed against respective traffic volumes 
in these time intervals. Analyses were made on different lanes as well as on different test sites.  

Questionnaire Survey

Following the vehicle headway analysis, a questionnaire survey was designed and deployed in two 
phases to help find the causes of tailgating and to identify drivers’ preferences on a few proposed 
tailgating treatments. The first phase was designed to identify the causal factors of tailgating and 
to gain insights about drivers’ experiences and perceptions regarding tailgating on Rhode Island 
highways. Various components of tailgating treatments were presented to drivers on the second 
phase to obtain drivers’ preferences on potential tailgating treatment systems. Some components 
presented in the survey were adopted from existing tailgating treatments in the United States as well 
as those currently used in some European countries.

The questionnaire survey was designed using Microsoft PowerPoint® and Visual Basic macros 
to  present  the  questions  and  to  collect  subjects’  answers  on  laptop  computers.  Questions  in  the 
survey might require either a single or multiple answers. The first phase of the survey contained 19 
questions designed to collect drivers’ opinions on tailgating and to find out drivers’ perceptions of 
tailgating and its causes and effects. It also surveyed drivers’ behavior when they were following 
other vehicles or being followed. The second phase of the survey was designed to find drivers’ 
preferences on components of a tailgating treatment system. These components include: reference 
marking  (pavement  marking,  roadside  marking)  and  advisory  message  sign  (dynamic  message 
sign, variable message sign, or fixed road sign). This phase was presented with both auditory and 
written instructions starting with information about the proper headway to maintain while driving on 
highways. Six questions were presented in the second phase. The first question surveyed a subject’s 
preference on reference markings. Four simulated driving videos with different reference markings 
built in (painted dots, painted arrows, neon/hot-pink roadside panels, and painted bars, as shown in 
Figure 2) were presented in a random sequence. According to the subject’s answer, the preferred 
marking would then be incorporated in subsequent questions. The second question showed several 
text messages on fixed signs that could be used in conjunction with the markings (Figure 3). The 
third question inquired a driver’s preference regarding graphic-aided messages. The subject was 
asked to choose between the advisory sign with only the preferred text message and one integrated 
with graphics (Figure 4). Questions four and five were essentially the same as the second and the 
third but the road-side fixed signs were replaced with overhead dynamic message signs. The last 
question was designed to capture a subject’s preference on the type of advisory sign to be used in 
conjunction with the selected reference marking. By completing the second phase of the survey, a 
preferred tailgating treatment system would be identified. 

The two phases of the survey were conducted at multiple locations in Rhode Island in order 
to obtain a representative sample of the Rhode Island driving population. The University of Rhode 
Island and the Warwick Mall were among several sites where the survey took place. Subjects with a 
valid driver's license were randomly recruited at the survey sites with voluntary participation. Prior 
to beginning the survey, each participant read and gave their consent on an electronic consent form, 
approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. The subject would then start taking the 
survey presented as PowerPoint slides on a laptop computer. Survey questions were presented one 
at a time with no time limit.1 Answers could be made via a computer mouse and keyboard or via 
verbal communication with the survey assistant.

A total of 210 subjects participated in the first phase. Among them, 91 (43.3%) were between 
18 and 40 years old, 72 (34.3%) were between 41 and 60, and 47 (22.4%) were older than 60; 
there were 107 females (51.0%) and 103 males (49.0%). A total of 142 subjects participated in the 
second phase. Among them, 76 were females (53.5%) and 66 were males (46.5%); 63 (44.4%) were 
between 18 and 40 years old, 45 (31.7%) between 41 and 61, and 34 (23.9%) were older than 61. 
Age and gender percentages of the survey resembled the Rhode Island population.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Vehicle Headway Analysis

The proportions of vehicles following with less than two seconds of vehicle headway, i.e., tailgators, 
on the three test sites on Rhode Island interstate highways were tabulated in Table 1. The statistics 
were shown by test sites, by day of the week, and by time of the day. From the analysis, 61.23% of 
vehicles were tailgating during rush hour and 39.21% during non-rush hour. Tailgating situations 
during rush hour and non-rush hour were compared through paired t-tests and were found to be 
significantly different (p values = 0) at all three locations. The rush-hour and non-rush hour tailgating 
percentages on different days of the week were not significantly different. Small variations in total 
tailgating percentage during each of these two periods were observed among different days of the 
week. This also held true within each site. The rush-hour tailgating percentage ranged from 62.24% 
to 70.96% on I-95, from 56.81% to 62.59% on I-195, and from 46.28% to 56.50% on I-295. The 
non-rush-hour  percentage  ranged  from  40.62%  to  45.24%  on  I-95,  from  33.04%  to  38.91%  on 
I-195, and from 19.76% to 27.99% on I-295.  The percentages on I-295 were lower than the other 
two sites since its traffic volume is much lower. 

The distributions of vehicle headways for both rush hour and non-rush hour at the three test 
sites are shown in Figure 5. Vehicle headways collected ranged from less than one second to more 
than  30  seconds.  It  should  be  noted  that  large  vehicle  headways  were  not  generally  considered 
“following” and thus the distributions displayed here included only up to 10 seconds of vehicle 
headways. It is noticed that the majority drove with vehicle headways of less than two seconds 
during rush hour where more than half of that group were following with headways of less than one 
second. During non-rush hour, less tailgating behaviors were observed and most occurred in the 
one-second to two-second interval.

To further assess the tailgating situations, the percentages of the tailgators were classified by 
lane and bound and were tabulated in Table 2. It showed that vehicles in the high speed (innermost) 
lane exhibited the worst tailgating situation (highest tailgating percentage during rush hour) while 
the outermost lane had the lowest tailgating percentage (except the test site on I-295). This could be 
due to the fact that tailgating is correlated with speed, and vehicles travelling in high-speed lanes 
tend to follow the leading vehicles. Compared with their opposite bounds, higher percentages of 
tailgators were mostly observed on I-95 north bound and I-195 west bound, especially during rush 
hour. This might be due to the large vehicle volumes entering the Providence metropolitan area 
during rush hour as observed in surveillance videos (see traffic volume data in Table 2).

*RH: Rush Hour, NRH: Non-rush Hour

It was noted that the tailgating situation was more serious during rush hour than non-rush hour 
due  to  the  significant  differences  in  their  traffic  volumes. A  correlation  between  the  percentage 
of  tailgators  and  the  traffic  volume  could  exist. Therefore,  linear  regression  analyses  were  next 
conducted to investigate the functional relationship between tailgating and traffic volume at all test 
sites. Figure 6 showed that strong correlations existed at all three test sites since their R2 values were 
all greater than 0.85. It could be concluded that tailgating percentage increases as traffic volume 
increases among the three test sites. I-295 exhibited the most serious tailgating situation as it had 
the largest slope. 

To assess the correlations by different lanes, separate regression analyses were conducted and 

the results are shown in Figure 7.

As seen from Figure 7, strong correlations existed between tailgating and traffic volume in all 
lanes (R2 ranging from 73.7% to 84.3%). Although the innermost lane had the lowest slope among 
all four lanes, its large intercept value (about twice the value of any other lane) made it the lane with 
the most serious tailgating problem.

The  vehicle  headway  analysis  provided  strong  evidence  that  serious  tailgating  occurred  on 
major highways in Rhode Island and posed severe traffic safety concerns for highway driving. This 
finding strongly supported the need of a tailgating treatment system on Rhode Island highways. 
Since the tailgating situation was worse in the innermost lane, especially during rush hour, it might 
be more effective to place tailgating treatments, including roadside markings and advisory signs, on 
the left side of the innermost lane to mitigate tailgating behavior.

Questionnaire Survey

With  the  tailgating  problem  confirmed  on  Rhode  Island  highways,  drivers’  understandings  and 
perceptions of the tailgating issues and their preferences for components of a potential tailgating 
treatment system were next collected in the questionnaire. The participants were first asked in the 
survey to select and rank the top three causes of crashes among 13. According to the weighted scores 
(3 points for the first ranked, 2 points for second and so forth), the top three leading causes of crashes 
were distraction, speeding, and tailgating (Figure 8).

When subjects were asked about the possible reasons for following other vehicles, the majority 
(70.0%) indicated that they usually did not follow others; when asked if they intentionally followed 
other vehicles while driving on highways, 67.6% of subjects indicated that they never did; when 
asked about the reasons for not following other vehicles, 49.5% of subjects indicated that it’s safer 
not following others (Table 3).2 

When asked about the definition which best described tailgating, 76.2% of the subjects chose 
“following too close to the vehicle ahead” and only 11.4% chose “insufficient following distance.” 
This indicated that most drivers had only a qualitative idea of what tailgating means instead of a 
quantitative one. “Heavy traffic,” “slow car ahead of my vehicle,” and “I am in a hurry” were among 
the top three choices of tailgating causes (Table 4).

When asked about their reactions when being tailgated, most indicated they were affected by 
tailgators, and most drivers affected by tailgators reacted passively (Table 5). The top choice was 
“change lanes to let the tailgator pass” (34.1%).

When asked about safe vehicle headways, the majority of subjects (77.1%) indicated they knew 
what the proper vehicle headway was, 73.8% indicated that keeping a safe vehicle headway was 
very important, and 90.5% believed they always kept a safe vehicle headway or at least most of 
the time (Table 6). Along with the results shown in Table 3, it did not appear that serious tailgating 
problem existed on Rhode Island highways.

When questioned “how much distance do you maintain when driving at 60 mph on highways,” 
95% of subjects indicated they maintained a vehicle headway less than 11 car lengths, and almost 
half maintained less than four car lengths (Figure 9). These answers exposed a serious tailgating 
issue by showing that the majority of drivers who took the survey did not know what the proper 
vehicle headway was, and drove with insufficient following distance. When driving at 60 mph, a 
two-second vehicle headway requires a following distance of 11 car lengths (assuming a car length 
of 15 feet). Although 75.2% of subjects indicated in another question that they maintained a vehicle 
headway equal to or greater than three seconds, it is not likely they kept three seconds of headway, 
which is about 16 car lengths. Subjects’ opinions on vehicle headway expressed in car lengths could 
be more reliable since 78.6% of them preferred using car lengths to measure vehicle headway. This 
finding from the survey, in fact, did not contradict but confirmed the serious tailgating situation 
identified in the vehicle headway analysis.

When asked about components in an effective tailgating treatment system, 63.8% of subjects 
preferred a combination of both advisory message signs and reference markings. A total of 37.3% 
of subjects selected the painted horizontal bars as pavement markings, followed by painted arrows 
and neon panels (Table 7). Some thought the roadside neon panels were distracting while others felt 
that the arrows might suggest drivers to speed up. Compared with other age groups, drivers over 
60 preferred the painted arrows (32.3%) over painted bars (29.4%) although the difference was not 
significant. Female and male drivers did not show any difference in their answers.

When asked which sign message would be the easiest to understand, most subjects (40.2%) 
chose  the  lengthiest-worded  one  (for  example,  “Keep  2  bars  from  vehicle  ahead”)  over  others. 
“Safe distance 2 bars” ranked second (Table 8). This might be due to the fact that subjects were in 
a static environment where they could take as much time as they want to read the messages, and in 
that case, more information in the message helped their understanding. Since lengthier messages 
could demand more drivers’ attention in real driving, graphics could be used to help drivers better 
understand the message while demanding less attention. When graphics were added to text sign 
message, graphic-aided message signs were mostly preferred (86.6%) over text-only ones.

be easiest to understand?

When similar questions were asked with regard to overhead dynamic message signs, similar 
responses were obtained. Among responders, 45.1% preferred the sign with the lengthiest wording 
and 81.7% preferred it with graphics. When asked about which traffic sign drivers most likely would 
pay attention to while driving, subjects preferred the overhead dynamic message signs (46.7%) over 
the fixed road signs (29.6%) and the roadside variable message signs (23.9%).

The findings of the first phase survey showed that the majority of drivers considered tailgating 
a serious offense and one of the top three major causes of highway crashes. Most of them, however, 
had only a qualitative sense of what tailgating was about and did not know what the proper vehicle 

83

Tailgating Issues
headway was while following other vehicles on highways. As most indicated in the survey, they 
did not maintain sufficient vehicle headways. This finding confirmed the observations made in the 
vehicle  headway  analysis.  From  the  second  phase  of  the  survey,  it  was  found  that  the  majority 
preferred  regularly-spaced  horizontal  bars  painted  on  pavement  as  reference  marking  to  help 
drivers gauge safe following distance. Coupled with the pavement marking, most of them preferred 
employing overhead graphic-aided dynamic message signs to communicate to drivers about safe 
following distance. 

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

This study examined the tailgating issues in Rhode Island, identified causes and effects of tailgating, 
and surveyed drivers’ preferences on possible tailgating treatments. Through the vehicle headway 
analysis, a serious tailgating situation (61.23% vehicles were tailgating) was identified during rush 
hour. Less tailgating was observed during non-rush hour but there were still 39.21% of vehicles 
following with insufficient headways. Tailgating percentages classified by lane and bound showed 
that tailgating was worse in the innermost lanes and on bounds with high traffic volume. Tailgating 
percentages were correlated with the traffic volumes in the correlation analysis, and the serious 
tailgating situation in innermost lanes was confirmed. The results of the vehicle headway analysis 
suggested a need for an effective tailgating treatment system in Rhode Island.

The findings of the survey indicated that the majority did not know what the proper vehicle 
headway was and maintained insufficient vehicle headways while following other vehicles on Rhode 
Island highways. This confirmed the observations made in the vehicle headway analysis. Among 
the proposed tailgating treatments, the majority preferred horizontal bars painted on pavement as 
a means to help maintain safe following distance, and overhead graphic-aided dynamic message 
signs as a way to advise drivers about safe following distance. Based on this study, it is concluded 
that a proper tailgating treatment system should be developed and implemented on Rhode Island 
highways.  Survey  results  suggested  horizontal  bar  pavement  markings  and  overhead  dynamic 
message signs displaying graphic-aided advisory messages. 

The  components  of  a  tailgating  treatment  system  surveyed  will  be  further  examined  in  a 
follow-up study where a driving simulation experiment will be designed and conducted. Results 
obtained from the driving simulation, coupled with the findings from the survey, will lead to the 
recommendation of an effective tailgating treatment system. Field studies will be conducted after 
the implementation of the recommended system. Before and after statistics would be collected and 
analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the system in mitigating tailgating behavior and reducing 
rear-end crashes. The findings could contribute to the development of a standard tailgating treatment 
system  to  be  included  in  MUTCD  and  help  facilitate  more  efficient  and  safer  driving  on  U.S. 
highways.

Endnotes

1.  No time constraint was given since the questionnaire was designed to capture as much of the 

subjects’ responses as possible at this stage.

2.  The word “following” was used in the first few questions in the first phase of the survey to 

investigate drivers’ general following behavior, including both tailgating and non-tailgating.
