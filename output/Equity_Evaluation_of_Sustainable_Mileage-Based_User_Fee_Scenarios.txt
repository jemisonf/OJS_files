Equity Evaluation of Sustainable Mileage-Based 
User Fee Scenarios

by Mark Burris, Sunghoon Lee, Tina Geiselbrecht, Richard Baker and Brian Weatherford

This paper examined equity changes from the imposition of a mileage-based user fee (MBUF) based 
on how revenue is collected as well as how it is spent. Using the 2009 National Household Travel 
Survey  along  with  detailed  transportation  spending  estimates,  four  scenarios  were  examined. A 
scenario where an MBUF is combined with a federal tax and includes a greater focus on maintenance 
spending was the most geographically equitable. Researchers also found that considering funding 
disbursement when examining the effect of a shift to an MBUF may change the equity of a funding 
option as compared to only examining revenue source.

INTRODUCTION

The Texas gas tax has been 20 cents per gallon since 1991, and the federal gas tax has been 18.4 
cents  per  gallon  since  1993.  While  the  population,  number  of  registered  vehicles,  and  vehicle 
miles traveled (VMT) in Texas have all increased, funding for transportation has not kept pace 
due to inflation and the improved fuel efficiency of the vehicle fleet. As a result, while damage 
to  infrastructure  has  increased  due  to  increased VMT,  the  money  available  for  maintaining  and 
improving roadways is actually declining (Cho and Powers 2006; Cauchon 2010). Several solutions 
for increasing revenue have been proposed, such as increasing the gas tax, indexing the gas tax to 
inflation, expanding toll roads, and increasing the vehicle registration fee. The National Surface 
Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission provided several funding options to satisfy 
growing  funding  needs  but  identified  a  mileage-based  user  fee  (MBUF)  as  the  best  long-term 
strategy (National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission 2009). Based on 
this background, this research will focus on the effect of an MBUF on equity.

The objective of this research is to examine the equity impacts resulting from not only a change 
in how transportation funding is assessed and collected but also in how it is spent. Several likely 
funding  scenarios were developed, focusing on asset management and environmental sustainability. 
For example, one scenario directs a much larger portion of revenues to the repair and maintenance 
of transportation infrastructure than currently planned. Planning documents examined for this effort 
indicate that funding shortfalls will result in a lower emphasis on maintenance related activities in 
the state (Texas Department of Transportation 2012a). In fact, there is current consideration to al-
low lower-functional-classification roads be maintained at a lower pavement score than those in a 
higher functional class in order to preserve maintenance funds. This research examines the impact 
of diverting a larger portion of transportation funding to maintenance, relative to current state plans, 
with respect to geographic equity. Another scenario charges vehicles an MBUF while focusing ad-
ditional spending on environmentally friendly projects such as transit system expansion projects. 
Thus, this scenario would entail a significant shift from how revenues are currently spent and could 
cause  considerable  equity  implications. These  were  the  two  primary  scenarios  examined. These 
scenarios were compared to using the gas tax for projects as projected in the Texas Department of 
Transportation’s (TxDOT’s) unified planning program document (Texas Department of Transporta-
tion 2012a). With National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data for Texas, the change in user fees 
for travelers under the new fee systems was estimated. By combining this with how the new funding 
will be allocated, the research determined how much travelers would spend on MBUFs and what 

23

costs and benefits, was obtained.

The  second  section  of  this  paper  reviews  the  literature  surrounding  transportation  funding, 
MBUFs, and equity. The third section examines TxDOT’s planned future spending, by category, for 
the next decade. This research breaks the spending into six categories: 1) urban construction spend-
ing, 2) rural construction spending, 3) urban maintenance spending, 4) rural maintenance spending, 
5) urban environmental spending, and 6) rural environmental spending. These categories are useful 
for examining equity when funding amounts shift between these six categories. The fourth section 
discusses the traveler data obtained from the NHTS. The fifth section discusses the analysis meth-
odology and results from several scenarios examined. Finally, the sixth section contains the conclu-
sions and recommendations based on this research.

LITERATURE REVIEW

This  research  estimates  potential  equity  changes  when  the  transportation  funding  method  and 
spending allocations are changed. In this research, the new spending focus area is sustainability, 
which includes social, economic, and environmental progress of society (Zietsman et al. 2011). 
Thus,  equity  (sustainability  in  terms  of  social  progress  and  the  first  of  the  three  areas  of  social 
progress) is examined from the perspective of shifts in funding to asset management and protection 
of the environment (the other two types of societal progress under sustainability). The literature 
review examines issues surrounding these three concepts of sustainability as well as examining 
previous MBUF studies.

Sustainability

Sustainability  includes  a  holistic  consideration  of  economic,  social,  and  environmental  progress 
with  a  long-term  perspective  (Zietsman  et  al.  2011).  Social  progress  focuses  on  social  welfare 
outcomes, such as human health and education attainment, rather than on material wealth, while 
economic progress is related to the increase of quantity, such as the gross domestic product that 
measures the quantity but not the quality of market activities (Litman 2009). Environmental progress 
emphasizes a conservation ethic and policies that reduce any waste of resources such as air, water, 
and land. The principles of sustainable development have significant implications for allocation of 
transportation funding because transport activities tend to be resource intensive. Thus, if a sustainable 
development policy becomes a primary determinant in the allocation of transportation funding, then 
transportation funds will be used to increase mobility (the economic progress), improve equity (the 
social progress), and reduce environmental impacts (the environmental progress). For example, the 
additional funding for more transit projects may reduce the negative environmental impacts from 
transportation.

An MBUF can change a traveler’s behavior by changing travel costs, which in turn can affect 
energy consumption and emissions for each traveler. Thus, MBUF strategies can be designed to 
reduce environmental emissions. In addition, the funds can be allocated for environmentally friendly 
transportation policies such as public transportation and non-motorized modes. The equity impacts 
of such shifts are the focus of this research.

Asset Management

Transportation asset management is a decision-making procedure for making cost-effective decisions 
about the design, construction, maintenance, rehabilitation, retrofit, replacement, and abandonment 
of transportation assets, with the purpose of maintaining or improving the value of these assets 
over time (Meyer and Miller 2001). In recent years, the national costs of preserving and operating 

24

Mileage-Based User Fee Scenariosthe  current  transportation  infrastructure,  valued  at  $1.75  trillion,  have  rapidly  increased  (U.S. 
Department of Transportation 2007). If current trends continue, state departments of transportation 
(DOTs) and other public-sector owners of highway infrastructure will be unable to afford to maintain 
the transportation system, let alone construct additional capacity (U.S. Department of Transportation 
2007). Thus, a transportation asset management strategy may be a primary concern for allocating 
transportation funds through an MBUF policy. This research examines impacts of increasing the 
amount of funds spent on maintenance among those aspects of asset management.  

Equity of Transportation Expenditure

Equity  refers  to  the  distribution  of  impacts  and  benefits.  Transportation  planning  and  funding 
decisions have significant and various equity impacts. Transportation equity is commonly classified 
into two types of equity: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal equity means that same socio-economic 
status individuals and groups should receive equal shares of resources, bear similar costs, and be 
treated the same in other ways. On the other hand, vertical equity has to do with the distribution 
of impacts and benefits among individuals and groups considered different in abilities and needs. 
These differences may be based on income, social class, transportation ability, and need (Litman 
2012). This research focuses on examining horizontal equity with respect to geographic location 
(urban and rural residents), and vertical equity with respect to household income.

MBUF Research

There are only a handful of studies related to the equity impacts of an MBUF. Burris and Larsen 
(2012) recently examined potential equity impacts of MBUFs. Their research focused on the equity 
of funding collection. In their research, Texas data from the 2009 NHTS were used to examine 
the  equity  impacts  of  four  MBUF  scenarios:  1)  flat  MBUF  scenario,  2)  flat  MBUF  for  added 
revenue scenario, 3) three-tier MBUF scenario to encourage “green” vehicles, which have high 
fuel efficiencies, and an 4) urban versus rural distinction scenario. In the first scenario, a flat MBUF 
scenario, the rate of the MBUF was set to recover the same net revenue as the gas tax. In the second 
scenario, the MBUF rate was increased to raise revenues needed according to a 2030 needs study. 
In the third scenario, vehicles with high fuel efficiency paid a lower MBUF. In the fourth scenario, 
since urban roadways and rural roadways have different costs, characteristics, and travelers, rural 
and urban roadway users were charged a different MBUF. The vertical equity of all MBUF scenarios 
was similar to the vertical equity of the current Texas gas tax. These results were similar to a previous 
study of Oregon drivers by Zhang et al. (2009). In terms of horizontal equity, the urban versus rural 
scenario was more geographically equitable, and a three-tier MBUF scenario to encourage “green” 
vehicles was found to be the least horizontally equitable. In scenarios 1, , and 4, the horizontal 
equity was more equitable than the horizontal equity of the current gas tax. Oregon conducted an 
MBUF pilot study in 2006 (Rufolo and Kimpel 2008). The pilot study compared driver behavior 
under two scenarios: 1) being charged an MBUF equivalent to the amount paid under the state gas 
tax, and 2) being charged a higher MBUF during the peak hours and a lower MBUF during the off-
peak hours. Over 90% of participants stated that they would agree to replace the current gas tax with 
an MBUF. This result may not be surprising because the participants already favored the MBUF 
before the pilot study and thus participated. However, it is still impressive that 90% of participants 
agreed with the replacement of the gas tax after experiencing the MBUF. The pilot study also found 
that the MBUF strategy in the second scenario is useful to reduce the VMT during peak hours. 
Weatherford (2011) evaluated the equity impacts of a flat MBUF using the 2001 NHTS data for 
the entire United States. His research suggested a rate of 0.98 cents per mile to replace the current 
federal gas tax. This VMT fee structure would lead to less of a transportation tax burden on low-
income households, rural households, and retired households. The result that rural households pay 

25

JTRF Volume 54 No. 1, Spring 2015less under VMT fee structure was similar to results of a previous study by McMullen et al. (2010). 
However,  his  research  noted  that  overall  changes  related  to  equity  are  relatively  minimal.  His 
research also recommended that any future MBUF scenario needs to consider a policy to promote 
the use of fuel-efficient vehicles. 

DISBURSEMENT OF FUTURE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IN TEXAS

This section examines estimates of future transportation expenditures for the period 2012 to 2021 
and is based on the data from the 2012 Unified Transportation Program (UTP) (Texas Department 
of Transportation 2012a).

Classification of Future Transportation Expenditures

The future expenditure estimates are classified according to sustainability, as well as the region 
where the funding is allocated: 1) urban construction spending, 2) rural construction spending, 3) 
urban maintenance spending, 4) rural maintenance spending, 5) urban environmental spending, and 
6) rural environmental spending. Most transportation projects related to economic sustainability 
are  concerned  with:  (1)  the  enhancement  of  travelers’  mobility  and  reduction  in  travel  costs, 
which can also be viewed primarily in terms of construction projects; and (2) maintenance or asset 
management projects that economically prolong the useful life of an existing system. Thus, in the 
above categorization, construction and particularly maintenance spending is related to economic 
sustainability. Inflation and improved fuel efficiency standards will continue to erode tax revenue 
for future transportation improvements, so maintenance projects may demand higher portions of 
the budget just to keep the system operational. For this reason, this research separates construction 
and maintenance spending. Environmental spending is classified as the spending for transportation 
projects  that  aim  to  improve  or  preserve  the  environment  even  though  they  accompany  either 
construction or maintenance works. Funding for construction of bike/pedestrian paths and transit 
rehabilitation and improvement programs is included in our environmental spending category. The 
geographical distribution, rural versus urban, of future transportation funding is also considered. A 
review of how detailed spending estimates are provided in terms of geographical boundaries shows 
the statewide long range transportation plan (SLRTP) (2012c), the Metropolitan Transportation Plan 
(MTP), the Texas Rural Transportation Plan (TRTP), and UTP use the county boundary. Thus, this 
research also uses the county boundary to delineate between a rural and urban area. Furthermore, 
according to the Census Bureau’s definition of an urban area (U.S. Census Bureau 2012), if a county 
has  a  population  greater  than  50,000  people  and  is  contained  within  the  metropolitan  planning 
organization (MPO) boundary, this research considers the area to be an urban area. As a result, 54 
of the 254 counties within Texas are considered urban areas, and 200 counties are considered rural 
areas. In 2010, the 54 counties have population of 7,676,751 households (86%) and the 200 counties 
have 1,246,182 households (14%). 

Classification of Future Transportation Expenditure Estimates

The SLRTP (Texas Department of Transportation 2010), UTP (Texas Department of Transportation 
2012a),  TRTP (Texas Department of Transportation 2012c) and many MPO documents, such as 
the  MTP  for  the   Abilene  Metropolitan  Planning  Organization  (Abilene  Metropolitan  Planning 
Organization  2010)  were  selected  to  estimate  statewide  long-range  transportation  expenditure 
because they provide relatively comprehensive transportation plans over longer periods of time. 
However, each source had issues regarding the classification of future spending into our six identified 
categories. 

26

Mileage-Based User Fee ScenariosBased on review of the SLRTP, UTP, MTP, and TRTP, this research concluded that the 2012 UTP is the 
best source to use for statewide future transportation spending estimates. The future spending estimates in the 
UTP are reclassified into the six categories defined in the previous section. The UTP includes estimates of the 
total amount of funds spent from 2012 to 2021 for projects in 12 categories, two additional categories, and 
four programs (Texas Department of Transportation (2012a) for the categories/programs and their spending 
estimates). Thus, to reclassify the UTP into our six categories, each category/program of the UTP was first 
split into three categories: 1) maintenance, 2) construction, and 3) environmental. These spending estimates 
were then divided into rural and urban expenditure. If possible, the split of urban versus rural spending was ob-
tained through the total amount of project expenditures planned for urban and rural areas from a project list of 
each category/program of the UTP. If that was unavailable, then reliable data sources, such as the District and 
County Statistics (Texas Department of Transportation 2012b) that include the amount of the current construc-
tion and maintenance spending, were used instead. Since MBUFs will be collected from surface transportation 
modes, Aviation and State Waterways and Coastal Waters Programs are excluded in the analysis. As mentioned 
in the previous section, all counties within Texas were classified as either rural or urban using both the criteria 
of 50,000 population and MPO boundary for this analysis. After reviewing a description and the project list of 
each TxDOT category/program in the UTP, which define characteristics of each category/program, it was clas-
sified into our six categories as in Table 1 (see Burris et al. [2013] for details of the classification).

Table 2 provides the total amount of predicted spending in the six categories for the next 10 years (see 
Burris et. al [2013] for details of the estimates). Most transportation funds (77.6%) will be used in urban areas. 
Only a small portion of the funds (10.6%) will be used for the transportation projects related to improvement 
of the environment, whereas 52.0% and 37.4% of the expenditures will be used for maintenance and construc-
tion, respectively.

The estimates in Table 2 only include the funds for fully approved future projects. The UTP 
report also includes a total expense forecast. This provides the total future cash flows based on 
department operations, financial participation by others, and the dollar value of project commitments 
(Texas Department of Transportation 2012a). Thus, the UTP future spending estimates in Table 2 
do not include expenses and projected costs for project development, maintenance, operations, and 
debt service for new construction projects, and do not take into account all the expenditures and 
expected payouts from previous projects. However, the UTP does include an item called the total 
expense forecast. The total expense forecast accounts for these expenditures and is therefore closer 
to actual future transportation spending estimates. Since a detailed distribution plan for the total 
expense forecast is not provided, the total expense forecast cannot be directly classified into the six 
categories used in this research. Therefore, this research allocated the total expense forecast into 
the six categories in the proportions found in the future spending estimates derived from the UTP. 
Since the amount spent each year is different, the proportions for 2012 to 2021 are not exactly the 
same. Next, these proportions were multiplied by the total expenses as outlined in the total expense 
forecast to determine the total expenditures in each category. Table 3 provides the results of the 
classification of the total expense forecast into the six categories. Note that these estimates were 
used in the analysis as the future transportation spending in the six categories.

TRAVEL DATA

The NHTS is a large-scale, nationwide survey that provides planners and researchers with informa-
tion regarding the travel behavior of Americans, as well as demographic information that may affect 
travel (U.S. Department of Transportation 2010). The most recent survey (the 2009 NHTS) was 
conducted from March 2008 to May 2009 and includes over 150,000 households nationwide. One 
unique feature of the survey is that the data include VMT and fuel efficiency information by house-
hold. This feature can be used to estimate each household’s tax burden, either under the current gas 
tax or if an MBUF is implemented. Therefore, gas tax revenue collected either in a specific location 
(rural or urban area) or from a specific household income class can also be estimated. As a result, 
the geographical equity and vertical equity of the current gas tax and an MBUF can be estimated. 
Therefore, this research used data from the 2009 NHTS.

28

Mileage-Based User Fee ScenariosWeighting the 2009 NHTS Data Set

The 2009 NHTS data include a weighting variable that can be used to adjust the new data to better 
reflect all Texas vehicle-owning households. However, the weights cannot be used in this research 
without modification because the geographic boundary used by NHTS to divide rural and urban 
households is different from the boundary that was used to classify transportation spending. This 
may result in inaccurate analysis of geographical equity when considering a change in the tax system. 
The 2009 NHTS data set includes a household location variable with households classified as either 
rural  or  urban. This  variable  was  categorized  by  the  cartographic  boundary  that  only  considers 
urbanized areas, which consist of the built-up area surrounding a central city with a population 
density of at least 1,000 people per square mile (U.S. Department of Transportation 2012). This 
boundary  was  not  consistent  with  the  county  boundary  used  to  divide  the  rural  and  urban  area 
households for funding as noted in the previous section. Thus, each data set was analyzed to identify 
the number of households in rural and urban areas.

The 54 urban counties, as defined in the previous section, had a 2010 Census population of 
7,676,751 households (86%), while the 200 rural counties had 1,246,182 households (14%) (Texas 
State  Data  Center  2013a).  Based  on  the  2009  NHTS  data,  there  were  6,199,869  urban  Texas 
households (78%) and 1,714,454 rural Texas households (22%). The total number of households 
in the 2010 Census (7,676,751+1,246,182=8,922,933) is also different from the total number of 
households in the 2009 NHTS data set (6,199,869+1,714,454=7,914,323). The main reason for this 
difference is that the households in the 2009 NHTS data set modified for this research only represent 
vehicle-owning  households,  while  the  households  in  the  2010  Census  represent  all  households 
regardless  of  vehicle  ownership. The  two-year  difference  in  when  the  data  were  collected  may 
also produce additional differences in the total number of households. The 2010 Census data were 
the most reliable source and matched the spending data set based on county boundaries, and were 
therefore used as the true total population. However, the difference in the percentage of rural and 
urban households between both data sets needs to be considered because the difference is caused by 
the use of the different boundaries in both data sets. The most ideal method to adjust the difference is 
to recategorize one data set based on the boundary of the other data set. However, this method could 
not be applied because the 2009 NHTS data set only mentions whether the household was rural or 
urban, and not the specific address of a household. Therefore, this research adjusted the ratios of 
rural and urban NHTS households to match the 2010 Census. For this, the weight variable included 
in the 2009 NHTS data was adjusted using Equations 1 and 2:

JTRF Volume 54 No. 1, Spring 2015Estimating Future Travel Data from 2012 to 2021

The 2009 NHTS data only provided 2008 travel information for households. However, this research 
requires future travel data from 2012 to 2021 to estimate tax revenues from either the current gas 
tax or an MBUF.

Estimating NHTS Weights from 2012 to 2021. Each weight in the previous section reflects the 
number of vehicles that may have the same travel characteristics in 2008. Thus, the sum of the 
weights is the same as the total number of vehicles owned by Texas households. Those weights 
cannot be used for future estimation because the number of vehicles in Texas will change in the 
future. Thus, new weights for future travel need to be estimated. However, projections for vehicle 
increase rates classified by the household location (rural and urban areas) in Texas for the future 
are  not  available.  Thus,  to  estimate  the  number  of  vehicles  during  2012  to  2021,  this  research 
first estimates past vehicle increases in both rural and urban areas between 2001 and 2007 (Texas 
Department of Transportation 2013). Then, this research also considered past population increases 
in both rural and urban areas between 2001 and 2007 (Texas State Data Center 2013b) because 
the change in population generally reflects the change in the number of vehicles. From these two 
estimations, the relationship between population growth and the increase in the number of vehicles 
between 2001 and 2007 was estimated (see Table 4). Using this relationship and projected future 
populations (Texas State Data Center 2013c), the projection for vehicle increase rates was estimated. 
This projection was applied to the NHTS weighting factors.

Estimating Fuel Efficiency Improvements. The current gas tax is charged in proportion to the 
amount of fuel consumed. The amount of fuel consumed in each household can be calculated by 
dividing the VMT of each household vehicle by the fuel efficiency (in MPG) of the vehicle. The 
2009  NHTS  data  included  these  VMT  and  MPG  estimates  of  each  household  vehicle  in  2008. 
However, the average fuel efficiency is expected to increase in the future. This will reduce the gas 
tax burden of each household and Texas gas tax revenue because the amount of fuel consumed 
will decrease. Castiglione et al. (2011) provides the projections of average MPG for all vehicles in 
Texas that were used in the Transportation Revenue Estimator and Needs Determination System 
(TRENDS) model (Castiglione et al. 2011). The vehicle in the NHTS data set had its fuel efficiency 
increased using the projections.

Estimating Fuel Costs. The 2009 NHTS data included the cost of fuel (dollars per gallon) that each 
household paid for one gallon of gasoline in 2008. A shift to the MBUF will cause a change in fuel 
prices because the tax will be subtracted from the total fuel price. This change may also affect the 
VMT of households—as fuel price increases, VMT is generally reduced. This effect of fuel price 
change on VMT due to the shift to MBUFs was considered in this research. Thus, estimates of fuel 
cost for each household from 2012 to 2021 are also required. For the fuel cost estimates in 2012, 
historical data of average gasoline prices in Texas between 2008 and 2012 were used to estimate 
the increase (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2013). For the future fuel cost estimates from 
2013 to 2021, this research assumes that the cost of fuel for each household will change at the same 

30

Mileage-Based User Fee Scenariosrate as nationwide gasoline prices. Thus, projected U.S. gasoline price changes from 2013 to 2021 
were used (U.S. Department of Transportation 2009).

MBUF AND FUNDING DISBURSEMENT SCENARIOS

To evaluate the equity of an MBUF, this research considers the change in revenue collection as 
well as the disbursement of funds. Table 5 provides a brief description of the scenarios. Note that 
all monetary estimates in this section are expressed in 2012 dollars and apply a 4% inflation rate.

Static Versus Dynamic Scenarios

Revenue  that  will  be  collected  from  the  MBUF  in  the  future  is  estimated  assuming  no  change 
in driver behavior due to the MBUF (static) and a change in VMT due to the MBUF (dynamic). 
To estimate the change in VMT due to the MBUF for the dynamic scenario, reasonable values 
of elasticity (ratio of percent change in VMT to percent change in total cost of gas and MBUF) 
are required. However, since MBUF research is still in the theoretical stage, empirical elasticities 
of VMT and the associated price of gas/MBUF cannot be directly estimated. Thus, this research 
adopted the values of elasticity used in previous MBUF research (Burris and Larsen 2012) (see 
Table 6). Note that these values were derived from Wadud et al. (2009) and are based on the price 
elasticity of gas. These elasticities were used to calculate the anticipated change in annual VMT 
for households within each subcategory disaggregated by household income level and geographic 
location. Elasticities are based on the percent change in the total price of gas, not just the change in 
the state gas tax portion of the price.
