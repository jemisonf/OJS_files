INTRODUCTION

Traffic signal warrants provide the threshold conditions under which a traffic signal installation may 
be appropriate. The current version of the Manual	on	Uniform	Traffic	Control	Devices (MUTCD) 
(FHWA 2009), which serves as the national standard for the application of traffic control devices, 
includes  the  following  eight  warrants:  (1)  eight-hour  vehicular  volume,  (2)  four-hour  vehicular 
volume, (3) peak-hour volume, (4) pedestrian volume, (5) school crossing, (6) coordinated signal 
system, (7) crash experience, and (8) roadway network. Collectively, these warrants are designed to 
consider different conditions under which signal control is found to be a justifiable measure for the 
safer and more efficient operation of an intersection. 

Figure 1 shows the curves representing the critical vehicular volumes for four different lane 
combinations  of  major  and  minor  streets  for  low-speed  (i.e.,  less  than  40  mph  for  major  street 
approach) roadways.  The figure shows one curve fewer than the number of lane configurations, as 
two of the four configurations share the same curve.  A similar set of standards with lower critical 
vehicular  volumes  is  used  for  higher-speed  (above  40  mph)  roadways  or  for  communities  with 
a population below 10,000.  The four-hour warrant is met when, in each of any four hours of an 
average day, the plotted point representing vehicles per hour on the major street (including the total 
of both approaches) and the corresponding vehicles per hour on the higher volume minor street 
approach fall above the critical curve for the corresponding lane configuration at the location under 
study.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Minimum vehicular volumes were generally used in warranting installation of a traffic signal. The 
origin of the four-hour warrant is found to be based on a large number of curves developed as a part 
of the Cooperative Research Panels Highway (NCHRP) project. These curves obtained consensus 
agreement among practicing traffic engineers before being included into MUTCD. Texas developed 
a graphic form of the four-hour warrant. This warrant, adopted by MUTCD in 1985 and continuously 
modified ever since, evolves into the current four-hour warrant. 

Despite the widespread use, there are some concerns regarding this vehicular volume warrant. 
Sampson (1999) believed that warrants based on fixed vehicular volumes were inflexible and not  
often  accepted  by  political  decision  makers. TTI  (2001)  recommended  a  reduction  factor  to  be

applied when vehicular volume based warrants are used to warrant the installation of a traffic signal 
at an intersection with pedestrian trip generators (e.g., activities center, pedestrian transportation 
facilities).

Researchers have been using simulation of intersection volume to assess the warranting of a 
traffic signal. Kell (1963) used a computer simulation to compare total delay between a pre-timed 
signalized  intersection  and  a  two-way  stop  controlled  intersection.  Park  et  al.  (2000)  employed 
Monte Carlo simulation to generate the probability that a particular traffic signal warrant can be met 
at an intersection. Recent advances in traffic simulation software offer the opportunity to effectively 
evaluate the appropriateness of critical volume standards set forth in the four-hour volume warrant 
more than two decades ago.

An important objective that the standards should strive to achieve is the reasonableness of the 
traffic conditions experienced by minor street traffic under different combinations of volumes and 
lane configurations. Critical volumes that result in inconsistent or unreasonable driver experiences 
for minor street traffic could possibly lead to either unwarranted or overlooked intersections, causing 
intersections with a lesser need for signalization to be selected for signal installation over intersections 
that have a greater need for these measures. This paper presents a study to evaluate the performance 
of the critical curves currently used in the four-hour warrant for low-speed conditions, often referred 
to as “normal conditions.” Specifically, the study includes the following five evaluations:
1.  The performance consistency along each critical curve and among the curves. 
2.  The appropriateness of sharing a critical curve for: (1) two or more lanes major and one-

lane minor; and (2) one-lane major and two or more lanes minor.  

3.  The appropriateness of sharing the same critical curve for two and three lanes.
4.  The impact of different turning volume percentages on minor street vehicles.
5.  The impact of different heavy vehicle percentages on minor street vehicles.
The findings of the paper should provide academic researchers preliminary evidence of the need 
to revisit the current standards in the four-hour warrant. Practicing traffic engineers may use the 
findings to further investigate the appropriateness of applying four-hour warrant in their justification 
of signal installation.

METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010

The general methodology consists of the following four steps:

1.  Select the appropriate measure of effectiveness (MOE) that can best measure the quality of 

operation for minor street traffic.
Identify  the  simulation  model  input  data,  which  are  vehicular  volumes  combinations 
obtained from the critical curves in the four-hour warrant. 

2. 

3.  Develop  the  simulation  models  for  different  volume  combinations,  turning  traffic 

percentages, and heavy vehicle percentages under different lane configurations.

4.  Analyze the simulation results and evaluate the critical volume curves based on the selected 

MOE.

MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS

Potential MOEs for measuring the operation of an unsignalized intersection can include delay, stop, 
fuel consumption, and average speed.  It is reasonable to assume that favorable MOE values will 
lead to a better safety experience at intersections. In this study, control delay in seconds per vehicle 
(s/veh) for the minor street approach is selected as the MOE. Control delay is the component of delay 
that results from the type of control at the intersection. It is the difference between the travel time 
that would have occurred in the absence of the intersection control and the travel time that results 
because of the presence of the intersection control. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, 
queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. Control delay is the measure used 
in the Highway Capacity Manual (TRB 2000) to determine the level of service, and is commonly 
used as the measure to gauge driver satisfaction at both signalized and unsignalized intersections 
(Al-Omari and Benekohal 1999, Chandra et al. 2009).

MODEL INPUT DATA

Table 1 provides the critical volume combinations obtained from the three curves in Figure 1. These 
data are stratified by the proceeding five lane configurations (per direction as shown in Figure 2):

1.  Major street has one lane and minor street has one lane.
2.  Major street has one lane and minor street has two lanes.
3.  Major street has two lanes and minor street has one lane.
4.  Major street has two lanes and minor street has two lanes.
5.  Major street has three lanes and minor street has one lane.

For ease of reference, these five lane configurations are labeled as 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, and 3-1, 
respectively. For example, 1-1 represents the combination of one-lane major street and one-lane 
minor street. It is noted here that the current standard has the three-lane configurations, 1-2, 2-1, and 
3-1, sharing the same curve.

Each point on the curve represents a combination of major street and minor street volumes.  
The major street volume is the sum of both approaches and the minor street volume represents the 
higher volume of the two minor street approaches.  In the simulation, the volumes for each of the 
four approaches must be specified.  For evaluation purposes, the two major approach volumes are 
assumed to be equal and the lower minor street approach volume is assumed to be equal to 80% 
of the higher minor street approach volume.  Additionally, to evaluate the influence of the turning 
traffic percentages, the following three turning percentages, expressed as left-turn %, through %, 
right-turn %, were used: (10%, 80%, 10%), (20%, 60%, 20%), and (40%, 20%, 40%).

SIMULATION MODELING

Simulation Tool

CORSIM (CORridor SIMulation) was used to simulate the different traffic scenarios and to obtain 
the corresponding MOE in this study.  CORSIM is a microscopic simulation model and is capable 
of modeling traffic and traffic control conditions on both surface streets and freeway networks (ITT 
Systems and Sciences Corporation 1998). A microscopic simulation model is a definition relative 
to its macroscopic counterpart. A microscopic simulation model details the movement of individual 
vehicles, and traffic information associated with individual vehicles can be analyzed. First developed 
by the U.S. Department of Transportation in the 1970s, CORSIM has become a commonly used 
and accepted simulation model in the United States. CORSIM was designed to represent traffic 
flow on a roadway system using these commonly accepted driver and vehicle behavior models: 
(1) NETSIM, a microscopic stochastic simulation model for street networks, and (2) FRESIM, a 
microscopic stochastic simulation model for freeway networks. Furthermore, an important element 

11

Traffic Signal Warrant
of TSIS (Traffic Software Integrated System) is the TRAFVU (TRAF Visualization Utility) output 
processor, which allows the user to graphically view network and traffic operations.  

Network Coding

CORSIM is based on a link-node network model.  In this model, roadway segments are represented 
by links and intersections are represented by nodes. Figure 3 shows the link-node diagram of the 
base network used in this study. This base network was modified for different lane configurations, 
volume combinations, left- and right-turn percentages, and heavy vehicle percentages to simulate 
different geometric and traffic scenarios.
Figure 3: Link-Node Diagram of Base Network

Simulation Runs

After the CORSIM input file for the base network was coded, simulation runs for different scenarios 
were performed by modifying the base input file.  Table 1 shows a total of 50 volume combinations 
for  the  three  four-hour  warrant  curves.  To  perform  the  necessary  analysis,  three  turning  traffic 
volume percentages were then taken into account to yield a total of 150 simulation scenarios. In 
these 150 scenarios, the heavy vehicle percentages are assumed to be 5%.  To evaluate the effect of 
different heavy vehicle percentages on minor street delay, another 60 scenarios based on the more 
common 2-1 lane configuration were created. These 60 scenarios are stratified by three different 
turning percentages and two different heavy vehicle percentages (10% and 20%). Therefore, a total 
of 210 scenarios were created.

To simulate “normal” conditions (i.e., major street approach speeds of up to 40 mph), the free-
flow speed on the major street is set at 35 mph.  Due to the stochastic nature of simulation models, 
simulation runs based on different random numbers may produce significantly different results. Five 
to 10 simulation replications have been commonly used in traffic simulation studies.  In this study, 

12

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010
10 replications were performed for each scenario, which results in a total of 2,100 simulation runs.  
The traffic delays from the 10 replications were then averaged to obtain the final average for each 
scenario.

Simulation Outputs

The simulated average control delays for the 150 scenarios (5% heavy vehicle percentage) are given 
in Table 2. The results are stratified by the five different lane configurations, three turning volume 
percentages, and 10 volume combinations.  Table 3 gives the simulated average control delays for 
another 60 scenarios stratified by different left- and right-turning percentages for two additional 
heavy vehicle percentages (10% and 20%).

EVALUATION

Delay Consistency 

Figure 4 plots the average control delay for the 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2 lane configurations for the case 
of (40%, 20%, 40%) turning percentages.  It can be seen from the figure that minor street traffic in 
the case of the 2-1 lane configuration experienced a significantly higher delay than those for the 1-1 
and 2-2 lane configurations, especially at higher major street volumes. When major street traffic is 
at 1,100 vph or higher, the delay experienced by minor street traffic for the 2-1 lane configuration 
is about 100% higher than that of the 1-1 lane configuration, and 60% higher than that of the 2-2 
configuration. For example, when major street volume is at 1400 vph, the average delay for minor 
street traffic (at 80 vph, see Table 2) under the 2-1 configuration is about 48 s/veh.  However, for the 
2-2 lane configuration, the average delay for minor street traffic (at 115 vph, see Table 2) drops to 
31 s/veh.  There is no apparent reason for minor street traffic to experience 60% more delay simply 
because the minor street approach has one lane rather than two lanes.  This suggests a possible 
need to adjust the two critical volumes for minor street traffic (e.g., 80 vph for one lane and 115 
vph for two lanes at major street traffic = 1400 vph) in order to make the two critical volumes more 
consistent.

Figure 4 also shows that the delay is lengthened by major street traffic volumes at an increasing 
rate. While it can be argued that when major street volumes are higher, minor street vehicles are 
expected to tolerate a higher delay, whether the magnitude of the increase is reasonable should be 
subjected to further scrutiny. For example, based on the current curve in four-hour warrant (Figure 
1), for the 2-1 lane configuration, an unsignalized intersection with minor street traffic experiencing 
as low as 10 sec/veh (at 500 vph major street traffic) has the same chance of being signalized as 
another intersection with minor street traffic experiencing as high as 48 sec/veh (at 1,400 vph major 
street  traffic). This  large  difference  suggests  that  the  current  standard  is  more  likely  to  warrant 
an intersection with low major street volume, one that may not require signalization, rather than 
warrant one under high major street traffic, which evinces a greater need.

Sharing the Same Curve for 2-1 and 1-2 Lane Configurations

Figure 5 plots the control delays for the 2-1 and 1-2 lane configurations with (20%, 60%, 20%) 
turning percentages. Since these two lane configurations share the same critical curve, the volume 
combinations used in the simulation are also the same.   

It can be seen from the figure that the delay for the 2-1 lane configuration is significantly higher 
than the 1-2 counterpart. This suggests that a separate critical curve should perhaps be used for each 
lane configuration, especially at high major street volume, when the two configurations experienced 
more than 100% difference in delay.

Traffic Signal Warrant
Sharing the Same Curve for Two Lanes and Three or More Lanes

The current four-hour warrant uses the same curve for both two lanes and more than two lanes.  For 
evaluation purposes, a configuration with three major street lanes (i.e., 3-1) was created.  Figure 6 
shows the delay comparisons for the 3-1 and 2-1 lane configurations based on the (10%, 80%, 10%) 
turning percentages. As expected, the average control delay for the three-lane case is consistently 
higher than the two-lane counterpart, as it is obvious that crossing a six-lane arterial is much harder 
than crossing one with four lanes.  In recent years, mounting traffic congestion has led to a significant 
increase in the number of these six-lane arterials in urban areas.  It is thus important to consider the 
impact of two additional lanes on minor street traffic, and possibly create a separate set of critical 
volumes for each lane configuration.

Figure 6:  Delay Comparisons Between 3-1 and 2-1 Lane Configurations 
 

at (10%, 80%, 10%) Turning Percentages

Turning Volume Percentages

Depending on local conditions, an unsignalized intersection can experience a wide range of turning 
movement  percentages,  which  can  have  a  considerable  impact  on  minor  street  operation.    The 
current standard does not consider these turning percentages.  Thus, theoretically, an intersection 
with 100% right turns is treated the same as one with 100% left turns, even though the latter is 
likely to experience a much higher delay while the former may only need to increase right-turn 
opportunities, such as by adding a right-turn bay rather than signalization.  

Figures 7 (a) to (d) compares the control delays for three turning percentages ranging from low to 
high left- and right-turn vehicles for the 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, and 2-2 lane configurations, respectively.  As 
expected, the higher the left- and right-turn percentages, the higher the average delay experienced 
by the minor street vehicles.  The difference also becomes increasingly larger with higher major 
street volumes. These observations are consistent for all four of the lane configurations.  The results 
suggest a possible need to consider turning percentages in the four-hour warrant.

Heavy Vehicle Percentages

Figures 8 (a) to (c) compare the control delays for three heavy vehicle percentages ranging from 
low  to  high  for  three  different  left-  and  right-turn  vehicle  percentages,  respectively.   The  same 
percentages are assumed for both minor and major streets.  The results show that, as expected, the

average delay for minor street traffic increases with increasing heavy vehicle percentage, especially 
at higher turning volumes.  It should be recognized that the difference in delay in this case is not 
as large simply because the percentages evaluated are not significantly different (15% between the 
lowest and highest percentage) to reflect the more typical range of heavy vehicles on local streets.  
In other words, it should not be interpreted as heavy vehicles having less of an impact than, for 
example, turning percentages.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Today’s  advances  in  traffic  simulation  software  provide  opportunities  for  the  reevaluation  and 
revision of the decades old traffic standards currently in effect. This paper has presented results 
from a simulation evaluation of the critical volume curves of the four-hour signal warrant based 
on the average control delay experienced by minor street traffic. In this study, CORSIM was used 
as  the  evaluation  tool  to  simulate  a  two-way  stop-controlled  intersection  for  five  different  lane 
configurations under various combinations of major and minor street volumes.  The results show 
that:

1.  The delays are significantly inconsistent along the different volume combinations of major 

and minor streets and among the different lane configurations evaluated.

2.  There is a major difference in the delay experienced by minor street traffic under the two 
lane configurations (2-1 and 1-2) that currently share the same critical curves, suggesting a 
possible need to create a separate critical curve for each.

3.  Whether the major street has four or six lanes has a major impact on minor street delay, 
suggesting  a  possible  need  to  have  separate  critical  curves  for  four-lane  and  six-lane 
arterials, especially in light of the increasing number of six-lane arterials in urban areas.

4.  The percentages of left- and right-turn vehicles, which are not considered in the current 

four-hour warrant, have a significant impact on minor street delay.

5.  The percentages of heavy vehicles, which are not currently considered in any of the existing 

warrants, have a significant impact on traffic operations at unsignalized intersections.

The above findings are based on the current standards for low-speed major streets (i.e., speeds 
of up to 40 mph for major street approach, which are normal conditions defined in MUCTD).  The 
impacts for high-speed major streets (i.e., speeds of above 40 mph for major street approach) can 
be similarly evaluated.  The findings of this study provide some preliminary evidence of the need 
to revisit the current standards in the four-hour warrant, and to perform further research to possibly 
refine them in order to better identify intersections that merit signalization.  It is understood that 
various factors (e.g., empirical values, judgments) went into the establishment of the MUTCD’S 
critical vehicular volumes, which were not simply developed based on numerical analysis. It is also 
recognized that the signal warrants should generally be kept as simple as possible, however, standards 
that can lead to poor decisions should be reviewed and modified as needed. This is especially true 
for those factors that can be incorporated without significantly complicating the application, such 
as adjusting for more appropriate volume combinations and having separate critical curves for the 
1-2 and 2-1 lane configurations, both of which can potentially achieve a more consistent traffic 
experience for motorists.
