Railroad Operational Performance 
in the United States

by Denver Tolliver, John Bitzan, and Doug Benson

This	 paper	 examines	 the	 effects	 of	 increased	 car	 weights,	 train	 size,	 and	 distance	 on	 railroad	
operational	performance,	which	is	measured	in	revenue	ton-miles	per	train	hour.	A	statistical	model	
is	estimated	from	Class	I	data	that	explains	most	of	the	variation	in	this	index,	while	controlling	for	
commodity	and	fixed	network	effects.	The	results	suggest	that	length	of	haul,	net	load,	and	train	size	
contributed	significantly	to	performance	gains	from	1987	to	2006.	However,	train	miles	per	track	
mile	increased	by	89%	during	the	same	period,	resulting	in	line	and	yard	congestion.

Introduction

In 2006, Class I railroads moved 32 million carloads of freight (including 12.3 million trailers and 
containers) and provided 1.77 trillion ton-miles of service (AAR 2007).  Transportation agencies in 
the United States are hoping to limit the growth of highway congestion in key intercity corridors by 
keeping freight on rail lines instead of highways (AASHTO 2003). From a multimodal perspective, 
it is important to understand the factors that have contributed to railroad performance. 

Railroad performance could be defined in many ways. In this paper, we have selected a measure 
that has historically been used by the American Association of Railroads (AAR): net or revenue 
ton-miles per train-hour. This measure reflects train speed and revenue tonnage and is a composite 
measure of the capability to efficiently move freight in intercity corridors. Other potential indicators 
(such as speed, tonnage, or congestion) measure only one aspect of railroad performance.

Many studies have addressed railroad productivity and costs, including Lee and Baumel (1987); 
Berndt, Friedlaender, Chiang, and Vellturo (1993); Wilson (1997); Martland (1999); Oum, Waters, 
and Yu (1993); and Bitzan and Keeler (2003). While this paper benefits from this research, it does 
not attempt to measure railroad multi-factor productivity or cost. Instead, the primary objective 
is to show the effects of increased car weights, train lengths, and shipment distances on line-haul 
performance. A better understanding of these factors is important in assessing the performance of 
surface transportation modes within multimodal corridors.

Performance Index 

The Association of American Railroads publishes an index: net	ton-miles	per	train	hour. This index 
“reflects both the number of tons hauled and the miles traveled during an average hour of a freight 
train’s operation” (AAR 2007). The numerator of this index (net or revenue ton-miles) is a measure 
of railroad output. A performance objective is to move a given number of revenue ton-miles with 
the fewest possible train hours. In doing so, both road and yard hours are important. Most cars 
require switching and blocking services at origin and destination, as well as at intermediate locations 
(Figure 1). For this reason, the denominator of our index is total road and yard hours (TH), which is 
different from the AAR’s index, which reflects road train hours only.

The trend in revenue ton-miles per train hour (RTM/TH) from 1987 through 2006 is shown in 
Figure 2. The index increased from 33,108 in 1987 to 40,258 in 1992. The remainder of the period 
is characterized by ups and downs, with the high value for the period (44,128) being recorded in 
2002. The index subsequently declined to 42,618 in 2006. Nevertheless, it increased by 29% from 
1987 through 2006.

Other performance indicators could have been selected for this study, including train speed, 
tonnage, or yard dwell time. However, none of these factors are stand-alone or composite indicators. 
The operational factors (or independent variables) which affect revenue ton-miles per train hour are 
discussed next.

Density

Density is a measure of utilization of railroad infrastructure. It can be computed by dividing annual 
train miles by running track miles. Running track miles include first main tracks; second, third, 
and fourth main tracks; and passing and side tracks. Collectively, these tracks (along with signal 
aspects1, block lengths2, and other traffic control factors) govern the capacities of rail lines. 

As shown in Figure 3, train density has risen over time. Train miles per running track mile 
increased from 1,939 in 1987 to 3,665 in 2006. As traffic increased, railroads added main, passing, 
and side tracks in high-density corridors. For example, the ratio of second and other main track 
88

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010
to first main track increased from 14.7% in 1987 to 19% in 2006 (computed from R-1 reports).3 
However, as the chart shows, train miles have been increasing at a faster pace than track miles.

While density is beneficial, additional capacity may be needed as traffic grows. A study by Cambridge 
Systematics, Inc. (2007) indicates that 12% to 13% of U.S. rail lines are at or near capacity. Another 
39% have volume/capacity ratios of 0.4 to 0.7. With continued traffic growth, 45% of U.S. rail lines 
are projected to be near, at, or beyond capacity in 2035 without expansions (Cambridge Systematics, 
Inc. 2007).

Data Sources

This paper utilizes 20 years of Class I railroad data from R-1 reports, which are submitted annually 
to the Surface Transportation Board (STB). This database includes 193 observations from 1987 
through  2006.  Information  for  the  following  railroads  are  used: Atchison,  Topeka,  &  Sante  Fe 
(ATSF), Burlington Northern (BN), BNSF, Chicago & Northwestern (CNW), Conrail (CR), CSX, 
Grand Trunk Western (GTW), Illinois Central (IC), Kansas City Southern (KCS), Norfolk Southern 
(NS), Soo Line (SOO), Southern Pacific (SP), and Union Pacific (UP). Some of these railroads were 
merged during the period and their names are no longer used.

The  primary  sources  of  information  are  Schedules  700  and  755  of  the  R1  Report  and  the 
Quarterly Commodity Statistics (QCS) report. It is a report of the number of carloads and revenue 
tons handled by each railroad. Operational statistics such as train miles, car miles, and train hours 
are reported in Schedule 755. Miles of road and running track miles are reported in Schedule 700.4

Railroad Operational Performance

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE MODEL

In this section of the paper, a performance model is presented to explain variations in revenue ton-
miles per train hour. The model (shown in Equation 1) includes key operational factors such as train 
size, length of haul, net load, and road and yard congestion.

(1)			RTM/TH = f (ALH, AVCARS, NET, WTR, TD, YD, MR, COMM, RR, T)  

Where:

 

RTM/TH =   Revenue ton-miles per train hour
ALH =  
Average length of haul (miles)
AVCARS =  Average cars per freight train 
Net load per freight car (tons)
NET =  
Average way train trips per carload 
WTR =  
Train density (train miles per running track mile)
TD   =

Time (years since 1987)

The  first  six  variables  are  of  primary  importance. The  last  four  are  control  variables. They  are 
necessary to account for the effects of mergers, rationalization, network effects, and variations in 
commodity mix (among railroads and across time). The operational effects of the primary variables, 
and their expected relationships to revenue ton-miles per train hour, are previewed in the following 
paragraphs.

Average Length of Haul

ALH is the average distance that a shipment travels on an individual railroad’s network. Because 
most shipments are interlined, the average distance of a movement on a single railroad is often less 
than the total shipment distance. As used in this study, ALH is intended to measure the effect of 
longer hauls on the efficiency of an individual railroad. The sign of ALH is expected to be positive 
for several reasons: (1) Interchange frequency decreases with mergers that increase ALH. (2) The 
yard hours required to originate and terminate a shipment are spread over more line-haul miles, 
resulting in economies of distance. As shown in Figure 4, average length of haul has increased since 
1987 as a result of mergers, growth in export/import traffic, and other market factors. The effects of 
mergers between 1995 and 1999 are apparent in Figure 4.  

Average Cars per Train

Maximum train length (i.e., the longest feasible train) is constrained primarily by safety and physical 
constraints, such as the lengths of side tracks. Maximum train length is the upper bound of average 
train length. However, average train length (which is measured in cars per train) is influenced by 
many factors other than maximum length, including network and route densities and commodity 
mix. Because longer trains utilize time more effectively, AVCARS is expected to have a positive 
sign.

An analysis of R-1 report data reveals that substantial variations in cars per train were observed 
during the period—both within and across railroads. Average cars per train ranged from 47.2 to 86.7. 
The overall mean (for all railroads) was 68.4 cars. The standard deviation was 9.4.

The net load per car (NET) is computed by dividing the revenue tons of freight handled on an 
individual railroad by the carloads. Logically, this variable is expected to have a positive sign in the 
model. 

An analysis of R-1 report data reveals that substantial variations in tons per car were observed 
during the 1987-2006 period—both within and across railroads. Average tons ranged from 44.9 to 
101.6. The overall weighted mean was 65.1 tons. The standard deviation was 8.0.

Train Service 

Generally, railroads operate three types of trains: way, through, and unit. Single cars usually travel 
in way trains at origin and/or destination. Way trains are small trains that operate primarily between 
remote stations located on branch lines and railroad yards. They stop frequently at stations to drop 
off and pick up cars. In contrast, through trains move from yard to yard and perform little or no 
switching en route. Unit train service is “a specialized shuttle-type service in equipment (railroad or 
privately owned), dedicated to such service, moving between origin and destination.”5

Way  and  through  train  services  are  not  independent.  In  most  cases,  a  way  train  movement 
precedes or follows a through train movement. However, unit and way train services are mutually 
exclusive for a given shipment or class of traffic. These relationships are considered in the definition 
of the variable WTR, which is defined as the ratio of carloads handled in way trains to total carloads 
originated and terminated. WTR increases with the proportion of carloads handled in non-unit train 
service. Conversely, WTR decreases as the proportion of carloads moved in unit trains increases. 
WTR is expected to have a negative sign.

Railroad Operational Performance
Density

The density variable used in the study (train miles per running track mile) was described earlier. 
Because  increasing  densities  may  reflect  line  congestion  and  more  train-hours  per  revenue  ton-
mile,  this  variable  is  expected  to  have  a  negative  sign.  In  addition  to  line  congestion,  railways 
may experience yard congestion as facilities are consolidated and traffic grows. In this study, yard 
density is measured in locomotive-miles per yard track mile (YD). The variable YD is expected to 
have a negative sign in the model, indicating some yard congestion during the period.

Miles of Road

According to R-1 data, miles of road (or route miles) is the length of all rail lines regardless of the 
number of tracks. Miles of second, third, and fourth main tracks; crossovers and passing tracks; and 
side tracks are excluded from this measure. Miles of road can be increased through mergers and 
decreased through abandonment, consolidation, or sales. Miles of running track can be increased on 
parts of a carrier’s system, while miles of road are decreased on others. 

Miles of road and track reflect the miles operated by a given railroad. Because some segments 
are operated by more than one company, the sum of the miles operated for the industry as a whole 
may be greater than the sum of the miles owned. However, all activity measures (such as train miles 
and car miles) reflect train movements over operated segments. Therefore, the track and operational 
data used in this study are consistent. 

According to R-1 data, miles of road decreased from 144,230 in 1987 to 119,684 in 2006 as a 
result of abandonment, the consolidation of lines after mergers, and the sale of branch lines to local 
and regional railroads. Over time, traffic has been concentrated on fewer lines. As a result, Class 
I carriers have been relieved of the time-intensive tasks of picking up and delivering freight on 
low-density lines. For the most part, these tasks are now performed by local operators with lower 
overhead costs and more flexible scheduling. 

Miles of road should have a negative sign in the model, indicating that the elimination of less 
productive route miles has improved the efficiency of train operations. However, miles of road may 
capture several effects. The route miles of some railroads jumped dramatically after mergers. In this 
respect, MR is an important control variable.

Commodities

The commodity variables are control variables. They do not directly explain operational efficiency. 
However, they may account for unique industry shipping patterns. Although railroads haul many 
commodities, 14 Standard Transportation Commodity Code (STCC) groups comprise 99% of the 
freight tonnage originated by U.S. Class I railroads. A commodity variable is defined for each of 
the 14 STCC groups shown in Table 1. Each variable represents the commodity’s share of total 
tons handled by a railroad. In addition, a variable is created for STCC group 42: empty trailers and 
containers. Although these movements are classified as revenue tons, the only revenue cargo is the 
tare weight of the trailer or container. The 16th variable encompasses all other commodities. To avoid 
singularity, only 15 of the variables are included in the model.6 

Accounting for Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Changes Over Time

Average length of  haul (described earlier) accounts for  increased efficiencies from longer hauls 
and reductions in interchange switching—both of which result from end-to-end mergers. However, 
other effects of mergers (such as network efficiencies) are accounted for through railroad indicator 
variables.

Each Class I railroad that existed during the 1987-2006 period is represented by an indicator 
variable – e.g., KCS. When the observation is for the Kansas City Southern Railway, KCS equals one. 
Otherwise, KCS equals zero. Additional indicator variables are defined for mergers. For example, 
the UP system includes three railroads that appear in the database: UP, SP, and CNW. CNW was 
acquired by UP in 1995. Union Pacific merged with Southern Pacific in 1997. In the analysis, UP-
CNW assumes a value of one in 1995, and each year thereafter – but is zero otherwise. Similarly, 
the variable UP-SP assumes a value of one in 1997, and each year thereafter – but is zero otherwise. 
Analogous variables are defined for other mergers or acquisitions. For example, Burlington 
Northern merged with ATSF in 1996 to form BNSF. CSX and NS acquired parts of Conrail in 1999. 
In 2002, the Canadian National Railway consolidated ICG, GTW, and other rail lines into the Grand 
Trunk Corporation (GTC). In the Grand Trunk system, GTC is one if the year is 2002 or later; 
however, GTC is zero otherwise. The ICG indicator variable assumes a value of one when GTC is 
one, or when the observation is for the old ICG prior to 2002. The GTW variable works in a similar 
manner. 

Collectively,  the  railroad  indicator  variables  account  for  the  unique  characteristics  of  each 
railroad’s  system  and  changes  in  network  characteristics  resulting  from  mergers.  However,  all 
changes from 1987 to 2006 cannot be captured with aggregate data. Many innovations occurred in 
train location technology, centralized traffic control, computerization of locomotives, and systems 
modeling. These “other influences” are captured in the time variable (T), which is an integer that 
represents the elapsed time in years since 1987. T is expected to have a positive sign, indicating that 
railroad operational efficiency has been increasing over time.

STATISTICAL MODEL AND RESULTS

The model includes variables of different denominations, and data ranges. A logarithmic form of 
the regression model is useful for this type of analysis because it allows for easy comparison of 
effects. The dependent variable is the natural log of revenue ton-miles per train hour. The activity 
variables, the commodity variables, and time are entered as natural logs—therefore, their estimates 
are elasticities. The indicator variables (which take values of zero or one) do not affect the slope 
of the regression surface. Instead, they shift the intercept, and in doing so represent each railroad’s 
unique system factors.

Main Effects

The parameter estimates and standard errors of the operational variables are shown in Table 2, along 
with the t-values and p-values associated with these estimates. A p-value represents the probability 
of observing a greater absolute value of t if the null hypothesis is true – i.e., the parameter estimate 
(the partial slope) is not significantly different from zero. 

As expected, the signs of ALH, AVCARS, and NET are positive. Moreover, all three variables 
are highly significant with p-values of less than 0.01. ALH has the strongest positive influence. The 
effects are as follows: A 1.0% increase in length of haul increases operational efficiency by 0.40%. 
A 1.0% increase in average cars per train increases operational efficiency by 0.35%. A 1.0% increase 
in net load increases operational efficiency by 0.37%.

As expected, TD and YD have negative signs and are highly significant. A 1.0% increase in 
train density results in a 0.32% decrease in revenue ton-miles/train hour. A 1.0% increase in yard 
density results in a 0.15% decrease in RTM/TH. In addition, a 1.0% increase in WTR results in a 
0.07% decrease in operational efficiency. 

Commodity Effects

As shown in Table 3, most of the commodity share variables (including coal) are not statistically 
significant. The unexpected negative sign of the coal variable may be the result of strong correlations 
with NET, AVCARS, and ALH. Coal unit trains have some of the highest net load factors and the 
most cars per train. 

Three of the commodity share variables are statistically significant with positive signs: lumber 
products, miscellaneous mixed freight (which is shipped in containers), and pulp & paper products. 
Some lumber products are shipped on bulkhead or spine flatcars with achievable net loads of 100 
tons.  Pulp/paper  products  include  woodchips  (which  can  be  loaded  to  100  tons  in  large  hopper 
cars), and newsprint and other paper products that use boxcars. Because boxcars can be reloaded 
by shippers, they incur relatively few empty miles. Therefore, fewer train hours are required to 
reposition these cars. 

Several  trends  and  efficiencies  explain  the  positive  sign  of  miscellaneous  mixed  freight: 
(1)  increased  use  of  double-stack  flatcars;  (2)  increased  use  of  40-foot  (versus  20-foot)  marine 
containers; (3) increased use of larger domestic containers; (4) increased use of intermodal express 
trains;  and  (5)  high  utilization  of  flatcars.  The  first  three  trends  increase  the  revenue  tons  per 
intermodal flatcar, while the fourth trend reduces the number of train hours required for land- and 
mini-bridge movements. In addition, intermodal flatcars can be reloaded with containers by the 
same shippers at origin and destination. Consequently, railroads incur fewer empty line haul or 
switching miles.

Three of the commodity share variables are statistically significant with negative signs: empty 
containers;  stone,  clay,  and  glass  products;  and  nonmetallic  minerals.  The  first  effect  (empty 
containers) is easy to explain. Although the tare weights of containers are classified as revenue 
freight, their weights are small in comparison with the train hours required to reposition them. The 
effects of stone, clay, and glass products cannot be easily explained. This STCC group includes a 
variety of dimensional building materials which are relatively light-loading and move as individual 
carloads (rather than as unit trains or multi-car shipments). Their dispersed origins and destinations 
(and  small  shipment  quantities)  may  result  in  less  efficient  train  and  yard  operations—which 
could partially explain the significant negative sign. Nonmetallic minerals account for most of the 
railroads’ non-revenue ton-miles, including the movement and distribution of crushed stone, riprap, 
and gravel used in track construction and maintenance. These movements result in train hours but 
no revenue ton-miles.

Fixed Network and Time-Related Effects

As shown in Table 4, T is highly significant with a positive sign, indicating that operational efficiency 
has been increasing over time as a result of technological or managerial innovations not reflected 
in the activity, commodity, or indicator variables. The effects of mergers are primarily reflected 
in average length of haul and the indicator variables. ALH accounts for the efficiencies of longer 
hauls and less-frequent interchange, whereas the indicator variables account for network effects 
such as combining lines, yards, and traffic control systems; eliminating redundancies and circuitous 
movements  to  avoid  interchange;  and  broadening  the  pool  of  labor  and  specialized  equipment 
available to the merged railroad. After controlling for ALH, the signs and parameter estimates of the 
railroad variables suggest that additional benefits have resulted from mergers. 

The sign and estimate of each railroad indicator variable is relative to the variable left out of 
the equation, which is the unmerged UP railroad. As shown in Table 4, the signs of the two UP 
merger variables (UP-SP and UP-CNW) are positive and their estimates are greater than those of 
the individual railroads (SP and CNW). Similarly, the parameter estimate for the merged BNSF 
railroad is greater than the estimates for the BN or ATSF. Likewise, the estimates for the merged 
CSX and NS systems (CSX-CR and NS-CR) are greater than the estimates for NS, CSX, or Conrail.

Moreover, the estimate for the merged GTC system is greater than the estimates for the ICG and 
GTW railroads. Collectively, these indicator variables suggest that—after controlling for changes in 
lengths of haul—mergers have resulted in operational efficiency gains.

Another network variable (miles of road) is also statistically significant with a negative sign. 
There may be several reasons for this result. (1) Miles of road decreased throughout the period, 
while operational efficiency increased. This suggests that the concentration of traffic on higher-
density lines resulted in more efficient train operations. (2) Many of the miles that disappeared 
were sold to local or regional railroads that consolidate and distribute traffic on low-density lines. 
Many of these operations are time-intensive, requiring lengthy switching operations at branch-line 
stations. In effect, the transfer of lines to local operators relieved Class I railroads of some intensive 
switching operations. The parameter estimate of −0.30 suggests that (when controlling for changes 
in length of haul and other network efficiencies gained from mergers) a 1.0% reduction in miles of 
road has improved operational performance by 0.30%. 

Model Fit and Properties

This  model  explains  more  than  97%  of  the  variation  in  operational  efficiency  (Table  5).  The 
R-Square adjusted for number of independent variables is 0.963. The F-test for goodness of fit is 
highly significant. Moreover, the coefficient of variation is less than 1%, indicating a very high level 
of precision. 

Two  statistical  problems  often  occur  in  panel  datasets:  (1)  nonconstant  variance  and 
(2)  autocorrelation.  Nonconstant  variance  occurs  when  variability  increases  with  firm  size  or 
output. For example, the variance in revenue ton-miles among railroads may increase with output.

However, the model is essentially one of indexes (e.g., train-miles/running track mile), in which 
size and activity are scaled. Thus, the null hypothesis is constant variance. The p-value of the chi-
square statistic used to test for constant variance is 0.70. A high p-value indicates there is little 
evidence to reject the assumption of constant variance. The Durbin-Watson statistic (which tests for 
autocorrelation) is 2.143. The probability of a greater value is 0.194. The probability of a lesser value 
is 0.806. These results suggest that serial correlation is not an issue. This conclusion is bolstered by 
an autoregression analysis in which none of the terms introduced to capture serial correlation were 
statistically significant.

Qualitative Factors Not Considered

Although the statistical results are good, it must be recognized that many qualitative factors which 
influence railroad performance are not reflected in the model. To some extent, management and 
market influences may show up in the indicator and time variables. Technological factors that cannot 
be directly quantified may be reflected in the time trend variable—which is highly significant. While 
commodity/industry effects are represented in the model, institutional and labor factors (such as 
regulations and work rules) are not; nor are the dual freight and passenger train operations which 
occur on some lines. All of these factors may affect the revenue ton-miles per train hour that are 
attainable  on  certain  parts  of  the  railroad  system.  Nevertheless,  the  model  explains  97%  of  the 
variation in operational performance among railroads over time. 

CONCLUSION

This  paper  has  analyzed  the  effects  of  key  operational  factors  on  railroad  performance,  while 
controlling for commodity and network effects. The results suggest that much of the improvement in 
performance between 1987 and 2006 was attributable to higher net loads, longer trains, and longer 
hauls. Other gains may have resulted from mergers and the transfer of branch lines to local and 
regional operators. The extent to which these trends will continue in the future is unclear. Increases 
in average lengths of haul are likely if land bridge and unit-train shipments grow proportionally. 
However, large increases in ALH may not be possible without mergers or consolidations, which are 

97

Railroad Operational Performance
unlikely at present. On the other hand, performance may be improved through increases in train size 
and net load. 

According to R-1 data, in 2006 the average train included less than 70 cars. Much longer trains 
are operationally feasible. To some extent, average cars per train can be increased through greater 
utilization of unit trains. As more commodities move in unit trains, a corresponding reduction occurs 
in way train activity. At the same time, net loads can be increased by substituting 286,000-pound 
and 315,000-pound cars for smaller ones. However, larger cars come with a price. System-wide use 
of heavier cars may require additional track investments and higher track maintenance costs. For 
example, Kalay and Guins (1998) estimated that track and bridge costs could increase by more than 
20% on some routes if 315,000-pound cars are used instead of 263,000-pound cars. However, some 
of the infrastructure investments needed to support heavier railcars may have been made in recent 
years. 

With growth in traffic, train densities have increased over time. The concentration of railroad 
traffic has undoubtedly had many benefits. However, the results of this study suggest that road and 
yard traffic may be at levels which are impacting system performance. This does not mean that all 
segments of the railroad system are congested. Since traffic is concentrated in certain corridors, it is 
likely that congestion is primarily a problem on some high-density lines. However, an assessment of 
the levels of congestion on particular lines cannot be made from this study.  

In conclusion, some of the variables responsible for the impressive performance of Class I 
railroads during the last 20 years have been identified in this paper. However, if the volume/capacity 
ratios projected by Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (2007) occur, future railroad performance may be 
threatened by line and yard congestion. Railroads are adding capacity by constructing additional 
main tracks in high-density corridors. Whether these investments are adequate to meet the needs of 
future traffic is a question that is beyond the scope of this paper. 

As noted in the introduction, railroad performance is important from a multi-modal perspective. 
Highway agencies are hoping to reduce the growth of highway congestion by keeping long-haul 
freight on rail lines instead of highways. If railroad performance deteriorates as a result of congestion, 
the performance of the surface transportation system (as a whole) will be affected.  

Endnotes

1.	 A signal aspect is a visual arrangement of signal lamps and/or positions that conveys informa-
tion about the status of upcoming blocks when viewed from the direction of an approaching 
train. The  indication  of  a  signal  is  the  information  conveyed  by  its  aspect.  For  example,  a 
red-colored light in a certain position (the aspect) means “stop” or “stop and proceed” (the 
indication). The simplest traffic control system has only two aspects. The signals display only 
red (stop) or green (proceed). However, a two-aspect system does not provide the capacity 
necessary for busy rail lines. In North America, three-aspect signaling is the most common 
type. However, four- and five-aspect systems are sometimes used. As the number of aspects 
increases, so does the information conveyed by the signal.

2.	 Block signal systems are widely used in the United States. In such a system, the network is 
partitioned into segments (or blocks) of uniform lengths based on train stopping distances. The 
train separation distance is prescribed in number of blocks (e.g., 1, 2, or 3), depending upon 
the number of signal aspects and other traffic control factors. The number of signal aspects and 
block lengths are key factors in line capacity and network performance.

3.	 The R-1 report is the annual report of a Class I railroad to the Surface Transportation Board. In 
the United States, each Class I railroad is required to report information to the Surface Trans-
portation Board for regulation. The R-1 report includes information on the miles of road and 

98

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010
track owned or operated by a Class I railroad as well as operational statistics such as annual 
train-miles, car-miles, and ton-miles.

4.	

In  some  cases,  it  is  possible  to  identify  suspect  R-1  data  by  using  other  variables  as  cross 
references. For example, the total tons and carloads handled in a year can be calculated from 
individual commodity subtotals in the QCS report and compared to the reported totals. Yard lo-
comotive miles can be cross-checked using yard switching hours. Yard locomotive miles should 
be approximately equal to yard locomotive hours multiplied by typical switching speeds (e.g., 6 
to 8 mph). Similarly, unit train car miles should be approximately equal to the carloads handled 
in unit trains times unit train miles.  Several outliers that affected the analysis were discovered 
using these methods and by analyzing data series. The most reasonable carload and tonnage 
data were used. In some cases, the calculated totals were used instead of the reported totals. For 
one railroad, yard locomotive miles were zero or a very low number for several years. For this 
railroad, yard locomotive miles were computed by multiplying the yard locomotive hours by 6 
mph. In total, these data substitutions were minimal.

5.	 This definition is included in the STB’s instructions to Schedule 755, on Page 92 of the R-1 

Annual Report form.

6.	 Singularity is a condition that occurs when one of a set of variables can be predicted from the 

values of the other variables in the equation.
