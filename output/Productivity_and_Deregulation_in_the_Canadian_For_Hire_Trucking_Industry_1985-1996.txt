INTRODUCTION 

Policy makers today take for granted the idea that economic deregulation yields net benefits to 
industry,  particularly  with  respect  to  helping  improve  firm  level  productivity  and  efficiency. 
Productivity improvements in deregulated industries can often be attributed to the fact that both 
incumbents and entrants must seek and implement technological innovations in order to survive 
and prosper. This paper will illustrate the degree to which innovation plays a part in productivity 
change in a large, deregulated transportation industry. To achieve this goal, a unique dataset from the 
Canadian for-hire trucking industry is used to compute a non-parametric industry level productivity 
index  through  the  time  of  deregulation.  This  index  is  subsequently  decomposed  to  identify  the 
sources of productivity change in the industry. 

Transportation is a vital component of the Canadian economy, and by value, trucking continues 
to  be  the  most  important  commercial  mode  of  transportation.  As  an  industry,  trucking  can  be 
separated into two primary sectors. These are i) the private sector, where trucking happens to be 
an  integrated  part  of  firm  activity,  and  ii)  the  for-hire  sector,  comprised  exclusively  of  carriers 
who only provide transportation services. These sectors are not mutually exclusive; large shippers 
often use both private and for-hire carriers to provide transportation services (Wood and Johnson 
1996). Whereas private trucking accounts for slightly more total transportation activity than for-hire 
trucking in Canada, the for-hire sector is still critical to the economy. While total trucking movement 
in Canada roughly tripled from 1987 to 1997 (Transport Canada 1999), for-hire trucking grew at 
a remarkable rate after deregulation. In the decade following deregulation, total for-hire trucking 
revenues doubled, while approximately 14% of for-hire trucking firms had revenues in excess of $1 
million per year (Nix 1996). 

The following section contains a brief institutional and historical review of the Canadian trucking 
industry. Then the relationship between regulation and productivity is described. A brief descriptive 
theory section highlights why productivity changes are crucial to the study of deregulation. Next, 
a detailed account of the methodology used in the study is presented. After a discussion of the 
empirical results, a brief set of conclusions ends the paper.  

REGULATION AND THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IN CANADA 

The  development  and  evolution  of  the  Canadian  for-hire  trucking  industry  relates  closely  to  its 
counterpart in the United States. The industry in each country conducts much of its operations as 

39

Canadian For-Hire Trucking Industry
part of the complete North American market. From a regulatory perspective, they have been treated 
historically in a similar manner by their respective governments.  

The policy of economic regulation in the U.S. trucking industry, which took the form of entry 
restrictions and rate setting, began as far back as the 1930s. Political pressure from rail interests 
forced  increased  regulation  of  the  trucking  industry  because  the  rail  freight  industry  was  itself 
heavily regulated at that time. Thus, some authors have concluded that the U.S. trucking industry 
was  regulated  solely  in  the  interest  of  creating  a  “level  playing  field”  for  all  firms  and  modes 
operating in the freight transportation market (Viscusi et al. 1996).  

Trucking regulation in Canada was also implemented as a response to pressure from the regulated 
Canadian rail companies, but similar regulatory policies also permitted easier access to the important 
U.S. freight market (Woudsma and Kanaroglou 1994). In both countries, the primary impetus for 
regulating  the  for-hire  trucking  industry  was  not  due  to  typical  market  problems  like  excessive 
concentration or conditions of natural monopoly. In spite of this unusual situation, regulatory policy 
towards the trucking industry in Canada and the United States remained unchanged for almost 50 
years.  

Economic regulation in the Canadian trucking industry most often took the form of restrictions 
on entry by new firms (Bonsor 1995). Certain special freight rates were also pre-determined by 
regulatory  fiat.  This  prolonged  policy  of  regulatory  protection  of  almost  every  trucking  market 
against  entry  certainly  weakened  incentives  for  firms  to  innovate  in  the  provision  of  trucking 
services.1 But by 1980, once the U.S. rail industry had been partially deregulated, the U.S. trucking 
industry was fully deregulated as well. Subsequently, the trucking industry in Canada followed suit 
through the early 1980s.2 By 1988, domestic trucking markets and routes in Canada were no longer 
protected  by  law  against  entry  (Dionne  et  al.  1998).  Most  analysts  agree  that  by  1993,  for-hire 
trucking deregulation in Canada was complete. 

In  the  years  since  deregulation,  the  Canadian  trucking  industry  has  continued  to  undergo 
substantial change. By way of example, 38 of the top 100 trucking companies (measured by total 
revenues) operating in 1990 were no longer operating by 1995, most often transformed or subsumed 
through buy-outs or mergers.  3,4  But evidence from the latter part of this sample shows that the 
importance of larger carriers in the industry declined, and the for-hire industry itself became less 
concentrated after deregulation (Transport Canada 1996). However, some industry observers believe 
that for-hire trucking deregulation in Canada has been characterized by extreme instability in prices 
and output (Nix 1996). In summary, it can be very difficult to judge the merits of deregulation by 
simple indicators of market performance. In fact, the very nature of the delivered good in trucking 
has changed due to several major technological changes that occurred during deregulation. 

The most obvious example of technological change in the trucking industry is the development 
and use of satellite/Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking systems, begun in the late 1980s. 
Among the largest carriers in particular, GPS has replaced short-range dispatch systems to ensure 
that delivery occurs when and where desired. The spread of this particular innovation has been 
driven by increased use of just-in-time logistics with precise delivery windows. Without a doubt, 
innovations of this sort have substantially altered the freight transportation industry, both rail and 
trucking, throughout North America. 

If we define productivity as the ability of a firm to produce outputs from a given set of inputs 
over  time,  then  policy  shocks  such  as  deregulation  affect  productivity  at  the  industry  level  by 
changing behavior at the firm level. In this research, the following questions are addressed:  i) Are 
industry level productivity changes through a transition to deregulation different from those that 
can be expected to occur in a regulated industry, and ii) in what manner has this particular industry 
reacted to the process of deregulation? In the next section, the first question is addressed along 
with a description of how productivity changes within an industry constitute a litmus test as to the 
“appropriateness” of deregulation for the industry.

DEREGULATION AND PRODUCTIVITY

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010

Trucking companies in Canada did not need to be particularly innovative or even economically 
efficient in order to survive in the regulatory era. Heavy-handed and long-term regulation in Canada 
meant that trucking firms possessed few incentives to innovate in order to gain competitive advantage 
(Viscusi et al. 1996). As might be expected of firms under such regulation, there is strong evidence 
in Canada that considerable resources were devoted to entry seeking and forestalling (Bonsor 1995). 
The  fact  that  this  industry  survived  under  such  conditions  does  not  imply  that  firms  were 
productively efficient in an absolute sense. But without loss of generality, it can be assumed that 
as the regulatory era drew to a close, the largest Canadian for-hire trucking firms operated with 
similar  levels  of  productive  efficiency. This  was  simply  due  to  the  fact  that  throughout  the  era 
of regulation, trucking companies had plenty of time to discover those procedures and processes 
required to efficiently produce output within the constraints (for example, inflexible route structures 
and rates) inherent in the regulatory regime. 

Under these conditions, it is likely that a relative lack of innovation in production technology 
existed  in  the  regulated  Canadian  trucking  industry  compared  with  what  would  have  been  the 
case under a competitive environment characterized by frequent entry and exit of firms. Without 
foreseeable changes in market risk or profit levels, trucking firms in Canada maintained the status 
quo with respect to industry structure. Such a stylized description of events also implies that the “best 
practice” technology in regulated for-hire trucking was well established and that all firms producing 
the same services would likely employ similar technologies. Thus, by the time of deregulation, for-
hire trucking was a mature industry in Canada characterized by stable prices and output levels with 
few differences among the operating procedures of firms.

Now consider the nature of productivity changes in this regulated industry. In the prolonged 
period  prior  to  regulatory  change,  it  is  very  likely  that  the  dominant  component  of  temporal 
productivity change for any individual trucking firm consisted of emulating those technological 
processes that were already well established. In the productivity measurement literature, this type of 
productivity change is referred to as a change in technical	efficiency	(Lovell 1993). More formally, 
the technical efficiency effect is defined simply as a change in efficiency relative to a static industry 
production possibility frontier.

Economists  assert  that  industrial  deregulation  generates  numerous  benefits.  But  aside  from 
demand  side  considerations,  many  authors  argue  it  is  extremely  important  that  open  entry  also 
stimulate  technical  innovation  in  industry  (Scherer  and  Ross  1990;  Gallamore  1999). Therefore 
in contrast to the situation that is argued to exist under prolonged regulation, it can be argued that 
changes in productivity over time through the period of deregulation are dominated (at least) initially 
by shifts in technology. This is known as technical change in the productivity literature. As opposed 
to the technical efficiency effect, technical change is defined as a shift in the level of best practice 
technology represented by the industry production possibility frontier. Among incumbent firms in 
the industry, those that survive the shock of deregulation will do so because they innovate and adapt 
to the new market situation.5

Using these basic arguments as a foundation for evaluating the merits of de-regulation, sources 
of  year-to-year  productivity  change  among  the  largest  firms  in  the  Canadian  trucking  industry 
during the window of deregulation are identified by computing and decomposing a non-parametric 
Malmquist  productivity  index  for  these  firms. To  the  best  of  our  knowledge  the  Canadian  data 
employed here are novel, but the methodology mirrors the work of McMullen and Okuyama (2000) 
measuring and interpreting productivity changes in the U.S. trucking sector. 

THE MEASUREMENT OF TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY

To evaluate non-parametric productivity changes in the Canadian for-hire trucking industry, static 
technical efficiency is measured using data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA is a non-parametric 

41

Canadian For-Hire Trucking Industry
efficiency estimation methodology consisting of a series of specially configured linear programs. 
DEA is a useful analytic tool to measure efficiency because it does not require any prior assumptions 
about  the  structure  of  production  technology  in  the  industry. This  flexibility  is  important  if  the 
researcher is somewhat ignorant about the structural nature of the production technology in question 
(Seiford  and  Thrall  1990).  It  would  be  imprudent  to  make  any  a  priori  assumptions  about  the 
structure of technology in this industry, especially considering the significant technological changes 
that most certainly occurred during and after deregulation. 

In  this  paper,  output  oriented  DEA  scores  are  computed.  Output-oriented  DEA  generates  a 
hypothetical measure of how much a firm’s outputs could have been proportionately increased, with 
inputs held fixed, such that it transformed inputs into outputs as efficiently as the best firms in the 
sample. Thus, output oriented DEA efficiency scores fall in a range between 1 and infinity, where 
an efficiency score of 1 means that the firm is technically efficient (or equivalently, the datum falls 
on the production possibility frontier). An efficiency score greater than 1 indicates that a firm could 
theoretically increase outputs by a factor of {efficiency	score	-	1} percent to produce as efficiently as 
the best practice firms in the sample. The linear program used to compute the efficiency scores (the 
basic output oriented, constant returns to scale version of DEA) is the following:

(1)    Min u,v             νXl 
  

s.t. 

  μYl = 1
- μY + νX  ≥ 0 
  μ ≥ 0, ν ≥ 0

Here, Y and X in the second constraint in (1) represent vectors of outputs and inputs respectively 
across the entire sample, whereas Xl and Yl are those inputs and outputs unique to the particular firm 
under examination. Also, μ and ν are vectors of so-called “virtual” multipliers, and are coefficients 
necessary to solve the linear program.6 The linear program is solved once for each observation in the 
sample (with the non-negativity and second constraint in (1) being common to each LP) and yields 
the technical efficiency measure for each firm. 

By definition, the reference data set of firms used to calculate the relative efficiency scores 
(represented by the second constraint in (1)) consists of all other firms operating in the same time 
period. Therefore, the level of industry technology in a given year is defined exclusively by firms 
in the dataset at that time, and not on a theoretical level dependent upon a chosen functional form 
of production. 

Table 4 shows the average DEA scores for all trucking firms in the sample spanning 1985-1997. 
The average scores fluctuate somewhat over time, as might be expected given the policy changes 
in the industry. Note that the highest (least average efficiency) score occurs in 1994 and the lowest 
(highest average efficiency) occurs in 1997. These efficiency scores are subsequently used as inputs 
into the computation of the productivity indices.   

THE MALMQUIST INDEX

The productivity index used in this paper is the Malmquist index. The index facilitates identification 
of temporal sources (or components) of productivity change. These components are: i) technical 
efficiency, or the convergence of technology among the firms in the sample over time towards the 
best practice frontier, and ii) technical change, or shifts in the production frontier due to changes in 
the overall level of technology used by firms in the industry.

In terms of the technical efficiency scores computed with DEA, the Malmquist index can be 

written in the following manner (Lovell 1993):

42

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010

(2)	

(3) 

And this equation can be decomposed into the following components:

In this notation, Do is a standard output distance function (Shephard 1953), which is simply the 
inverse of the output oriented DEA technical efficiency scores. This allows for a straightforward 
computation  of  the  Malmquist  index  under  the  chosen  DEA  specification.  The  superscripts  on 
Do indicate the reference time period (or technology) with which the scores are calculated. The 
superscripts on x (inputs) and y (outputs) indicate the time period of the data used in the index 
calculation. For example, if the superscripts for each distance function are the same, the efficiency 
score is calculated in the standard way using the data of other firms operating in the same time 
period. However, if the superscripts in the distance functions are not the same (i.e., t vs. t+1), the 
DEA efficiency score for an observation is computed instead by using, as the reference set, industry 
data from the adjacent time period. 

The first term on the right-hand side in equation (3) measures the change in technical efficiency 
between time periods, or the change in the DEA score from period t to period t+1. The second term 
measures pure technical change over time by computing modified DEA scores for a given firm in a 
particular year relative to the technology sets (the data on inputs and outputs) of both the previous 
(Do

t(xt+1, yt+1))  and succeeding ((Do
Intuitively, the Malmquist index compares the level of industry technology in the current year 
with those from previous and future years. The changes in the technical efficiency scores induced by 
changing the reference technology set are used to examine whether or not individual firms contribute 
either to the shifting of the production possibility frontier, or if firms are simply “catching up” with 
the prevailing level of technology. 

t+1(xt, yt)) years.  

As in McMullen and Okuyama (2000), the decomposition of the industry Malmquist index will 
be interpreted in the following manner. The technical efficiency term is called the “catching up” 
term (see also Fare et al. 1994), and measures the effect on productivity of firms catching up to the 
performance of the most efficient firms in the sample.

equals 1 when no change in technical efficiency has occurred;
is less than 1 when technical efficiency has declined over time;
is greater than 1 when technical efficiency has increased over time. 

This term:

•	
•	
The second term in the Malmquist decomposition is often referred to as the technical change or 
“innovation” term, measuring how much overall productivity change is due to the efficiency frontier 
shifting from one time period to the next. If this term dominates the index, the level of best practice 
technology in the industry has changed and the best performing firms in the industry became more 
efficient. This term:

equals 1 when no technical change has occurred;
is less than 1 when there has been regressive technical change;
is greater than 1 when there has been progressive technical change.

The Malmquist index itself is interpreted in the same manner as the individual terms. Thus the 

index:

equals 1 when no change in productivity has occurred;
is less than 1 when productivity has declined over time; 
is greater than 1 when productivity has increased over time.

By  using  this  decomposition,  the  structure  of  productivity  changes  among  this  set  of  firms 
during deregulation in the Canadian for-hire trucking industry can be identified. And since average 
indices of productivity and decompositions are computed, the results can be interpreted with respect 
to the entire sample on aggregate.  

DATA 

The sample comprises a set of the largest for-hire trucking firms operating across Canada.7 The 
data were compiled from several sources, including the Motor Carriers of Freight (MCF) survey 
conducted by Statistics Canada (1993).8 Even though there are more Class I firms in Canada (about 
350 in 1993) than in the sample, only about one-third of these firms were actually surveyed in any 
given year (Statistics Canada 1993). The sub-sample consists of those firms for which reliable data 
were available from the MCF survey through the entire period of trucking deregulation.9  

The empirical analysis is composed of two parts. First, DEA scores and Malmquist indices are 
computed using a balanced panel of 14 trucking firms over 12 years, from 1985 to 1996. Balanced 
panels are best employed in the computation of Malmquist indices so that reference technology 
sets do not change; this ensures consistency of the results between specific firms (Lovell 1993). 
But since only overall productivity results are of interest here and not results at the firm level, such 
consistency is not as critical. Subsequently, the second portion of this study computes Malmquist 
indices for a slightly larger unbalanced panel of 21 firms over 13 years, from 1985-1997. See Table 
1 for a comparison of sample sizes for the balanced and unbalanced panels.

Table 2 provides summary statistics for the input and output variables for the full (unbalanced) 
sample, whereas Table 3 provides the summary statistics for the balanced panel estimates. With 
respect to variable selection, non-parametric studies of productivity and efficiency of transportation 
modes have used similar variables to those chosen here (Bookbinder and Qu 1993; McMullen and 
Okuyama 2000). This set of input and output variables constitutes a parsimonious but reasonable 
representation of the structure of production in the trucking industry.

Some  size  discrepancies  among  the  firms  in  the  sample  open  the  possibility  that  not  all  of 
these firms are operating at constant returns to scale, and the assumption of CRS facilitates the 
computation of Malmquist indices (Lovell 1993). However, parametric studies of the U.S. trucking 
industry  offer  a  strong  consensus  that  the  for-hire  industry  operates  at  constant  returns  to  scale 
(Braeutigam 1999). Given the large number of firms operating in the Canadian for-hire trucking 
industry (over 8,000 operators of all sizes as of 1993; Nix 1996), it is likely that post-deregulation 
trucking technology operates effectively at constant returns to scale. Furthermore, it is very unlikely 
that  this  sample  of  large  companies  includes  any  firms  operating  at  increasing  returns  to  scale. 
Therefore, the constant returns to scale formulation used to compute the DEA efficiency scores and 
the Malmquist indices seem to be a reasonable assumption for this analysis.

As a final point about the data, there is no way to directly control for provincial regulatory 
differences because in order to obtain a reasonable sample size, the data necessarily include firms 
operating all over Canada.10 After the process of trucking deregulation began, provinces continued 
to exert varying levels of control over certain aspects of the industry, particularly safety (Nix 1996). 
But  entry  and  rate  deregulation  of  trucking  was  mandated  from  the  federal  level  and  therefore, 
was relatively homogenous across the country. Therefore, it is safe to assume that any regulatory 
variability found from province to province will not affect the basic results obtained here.

RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION

Table 5 shows the average of the Malmquist index for each year computed with both the balanced 
and  unbalanced  panels  of  data. Table  6  and  Figure  1  show  the  average  of  the  two  productivity 
components and the Malmquist indices for all firms computed with the balanced panel sample. Since 
the Malmquist productivity indices are calculated year to year, the productivity gains observed in a 
given year are relative to productivity levels in the previous year only. 

As a test of data sensitivity, the full (unbalanced) sample was used to calculate another series 
of averaged Malmquist indices and components. These are shown in Figure 2 and Tables 5 and 6. 
Overall, industry productivity increases steadily over time in the sample (Table 5). Both sets of 
indices  (balanced  and  unbalanced)  show  increases  in  overall  productivity  from  1986-1988. The 
effects of the 1990-91 recession can be seen as well in Figures 1 and 2, with productivity slipping in 
both samples. In fact, this recession hit the trucking industry particularly hard (Nix 1996). Finally, 
another noticeable increase in productivity appears starting 1994-1995, diminishing slightly towards 
the end of this sample.

The index de-compositions indicate that the technical change or innovation term dominates the 
Malmquist index over most of the sample, and especially in the initial period following deregulation. 
To help identify relationships between productivity and innovation in the data, sample correlations 
and a Spearman non-parametric rank test (for independence) between the Malmquist index and 
the de-composed terms were performed. One reason for computing the Spearman rank statistic is 
that as a non-parametric test, it allows a more general assessment of the relationship between the 
non-parametric Malmquist index and its components. The Spearman statistic indicates which of the 
decomposition factors is more critical to the calculation of the index. Both the sample correlations 
and the Spearman rank tests are shown in Table 7.

For both Malmquist indices (balanced and unbalanced), the full sample correlation between 
the technical change term and the index was extremely high (over 0.8 in both cases), exceeding the 
measured correlation associated with the technical efficiency term. In addition, in both samples the 
technical change term is significantly correlated with the Malmquist index (i.e., the null hypothesis 
of independence between the data series is strongly rejected). 

Conversely, the technical efficiency term is found to be statistically independent of the Malmquist 
index in both samples (i.e., we cannot reject the null hypothesis of independence), although weakly 
so in the unbalanced panel (P-value = 0.40). But overall, the statistical evidence presented here 
shows that the technical change or innovation term tended to dominate productivity change in both 
samples. However, variability in the values of each de-composition component across the sample 
(see Table 6) indicated that specific periods of interest needed closer examination. 

The  sample  was  split  into  two  crucial  periods  in  these  initial  stages  of  Canadian  trucking 
deregulation: i) the immediate post deregulation period from 1988-1993; and ii) the latter stages of 
the deregulation process from 1994-1996. Malmquist correlations in Table 7 show that productivity 
change at the beginning of the deregulation era was dominated by technical change or innovation. 
For instance, the technical change term drives the productivity index up to 1993 (with correlations 
of  0.983  [balanced  sample]  and  0.984  [unbalanced  sample]).  This  finding  is  consistent  with 
consensus about the time it took for the industry to adjust to the deregulation transition (Dionne et 
al. 1998). But the correlations in Table 7 also show that by 1994, the process of innovation driving 
productivity improvements was slowing. As time progressed, it is clear that the “catching up” or 
technical efficiency term eventually became the driver (i.e., there is a higher correlation between 
the technical efficiency term and the productivity indices from 1994-1996 than from 1988-1993 
within both samples) behind productivity changes in the Canadian for-hire trucking industry. Thus, 
the Malmquist index decomposition confirms that innovation among the largest for-hire trucking 
firms in Canada slowed over time after initial de-regulation, with subsequent productivity changes 
realized instead through the emulation of extant best practices or technology.

It must be noted that in contrast to these Canadian findings, McMullen and Okuyama (2000) 
performed a similar analysis on trucking and found that technical change in the early U.S. post-
deregulation period declined. The industries in each country are quite similar and there was no 
evidence of any fundamental differences between the two industries at the time of de-regulation 
(Bonsor 1995). In this light, one explanation for the observed difference in technical change that 

48

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010
is consistent with the interpretation above is that most of the large Canadian for-hire carriers in 
fact served markets throughout all of North America. The deregulation of U.S. trucking markets 
predated  Canadian  deregulation. Adjustments  to  U.S.  policy  changes  may  have  induced  certain 
operational changes among the Canadian carriers in this sample, including the need to improve their 
technical efficiency in order to better compete in the liberalized U.S. market. And while of potential 
interest, identifying the exact source of the changes in technical efficiency in Canada is beyond the 
scope of this study. 

CONCLUSION

A unique Canadian dataset is used to examine the relationship between productivity and the process 
of deregulation in the for-hire trucking industry. This research adds to the growing body of empirical 
work  concerning  the  nature  of  firm  behavior  by  decomposing  a  Malmquist  productivity  index 
computed through the time of economic deregulation in this industry.  

One desirable consequence of economic deregulation is that after implementation, firms will 
act upon a set of new incentives and ultimately compete by innovating. We identified such an effect 
within the early stages of trucking deregulation in Canada. It was also found that innovation in the 
industry ultimately declined over time, likely as a result of firms adjusting to the new regulatory 
environment by emulating extant technology rather than continuing to pursue innovation. Analyzing 
whether or not productivity improvements in Canadian for-hire trucking attributable to innovation 
simply fade after the act of deregulation or are cyclical in nature awaits further data. An extension 
in this direction would clearly contribute to the extensive and growing literature on innovation and 
industry life cycles (see for example, Cefis and Marsili 2005).

Events  of  the  past  two  decades  have  shown  that  technology  improvements  often  occur  in 
ways that were unforeseen before changes in economic regulation (Winston 1993). Sometimes an 
unforeseen technical change is obvious to the casual observer, such as the ubiquitous advent of 
satellite tracking systems, but in other cases technical improvements and their consequences are more 
subtle. It is in the latter cases in which the methodology and interpretation implemented here would 
help measure and identify changes in firm behavior brought about by deregulation. Ideally, it would 
be instructive to compare these findings with those from industries that have undergone a similar 
regulatory transition and examine whether differences exist across productivity de-compositions.

Endnotes

1.  See Viscusi et al. (1996) for a detailed overview of regulation and its effects on the U.S. trucking 

industry. The history and evolution of trucking regulation in Canada is similar. 

2.  The Canadian provinces enforced various forms of their own economic regulation, but federal 

level deregulation was seen as a crucial step to improving competition in this industry. 

3.  Since the focus in this research is on the behavior of the largest (Class 1) carriers, the total 
sample size is limited. This increases the risk of “survivor bias” over the sample (especially in 
the balanced sample) since these firms remained intact throughout the duration of the regulatory 
transition. But such bias is not likely to be an issue since the point of the research is to examine 
those firms who survived the shock of deregulation. 

4.  Through  the  sample  period,  alliances  were  becoming  increasingly  important  to  Canadian 

carriers looking to expand service into the United States (Transport Canada 1996).

5.  On  a  theoretical  note,  this  discussion  implicitly  assumes  that  potential  property  rights 
enforcement issues in innovation did not hinder deregulation. Those innovations that became 
popular  in  this  segment  of  trucking  (e.g.,  hub  and  spoke  networking,  GPS  based  logistics) 
49

were commonly known in the industry and clearly part of the public domain around the time 
of trucking deregulation in Canada. This is not to say that property rights issues in innovation 
will never become important in trucking, only that these issues do not affect the results from 
the period under analysis.

6.  Microsoft Excel Solver was used to compute both the efficiency scores and the Malmquist 

indices.

7.  Class 1 trucking firms were defined in Canada as those firms earning more than C$5 million in 
revenue per year. This classification was changed in 1996, but the old classification is relevant 
to the data used here.

8.  Some of the data used here are also described in Nolan (1998). The authors would like to also 

thank R. Laroque at Statistics Canada for compiling much of this dataset.

9.  We have made every effort to ensure that the firms in the sample do not rely upon “owner-
operators,” the use of which could affect the reported inputs for the firm, depending on how the 
firm chooses to report operating data to Statistics Canada.

10.  The data used are confidential, so identifying individual firms is not possible. However, both 

samples were examined to ensure that they did not include merged firms.
