INTRODUCTION

Government  spending  on  transport  infrastructure  has  long  been  considered  a  means  to  enhance 
economic development in both developed and developing countries. The significance of transport 
infrastructure investment has been clearly revealed in the U.S. government’s proposals and policies 
over  decades.  For  example,  in  President  Clinton’s  1992  presidential  campaign  document,  he 
proposed a “Rebuild America Fund” to allocate $20 billion annually for four years in four critical 
areas,  including  transportation,  information  network,  environmental  technology,  and  defense 
conversion (Clinton 1992). President G. W. Bush signed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient 
Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) in 2005, allocating more than $286 
billion over five years to maintain and improve the surface transport infrastructure of the nation. To 
address the economic recession in the late 2000s, President Obama signed the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in 2009 that included $48 billion for transport infrastructure. In 
2011, Mr. Obama proposed investing an additional $50 billion to modernize national highways, 
transit, rail, and aviation infrastructure systems in the American Jobs Act. In June 2012, a new 
surface transportation bill of $105 billion over two years, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st 
Century (MAP-21), was signed into law to reauthorize the federal-aid highway program.

Interestingly, regardless of the aforementioned policy focus, a consensus remains elusive about 
the effects of transport infrastructure on economic growth at the aggregate level (Pereira and Andraz 
2012).  The  potential  connection  between  economic  development  and  transport  infrastructure 
investment  in  the  United  States  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  academic  debates  over  decades. 
A  number  of  empirical  studies  suggest  that  government  expenditures  on  public  infrastructure, 
including  transportation,  can  potentially  increase  productivity  or  reduce  cost  of  production  and, 
hence,  increase  economic  growth  (e.g.,  Aschauer  1989,  Munnell  1990,  Fernald  1999,  Glass 
2008, Pereira and Andraz 2012). Alternatively, others find no significant effect or even a negative 
impact on  national  productivity (e.g.,  Holtz-Eakin 1994,  Garcia-Mila et  al. 1996,  Ewing  2008). 
Notwithstanding the diverse perspectives regarding transport infrastructure investment, the recent 
global economic recession has encouraged some policy makers to utilize this fiscal policy tool to 
promote economic recovery, reinforcing the debate about the economic impact of infrastructure 
investment.

The  role  of  trade  in  the  relationship  between  transport  infrastructure  and  economic  growth 
typically has been ignored in previous literature. Trade could contribute to both economic growth

and transport infrastructure (see Figure 1). The export-led growth hypothesis suggests that exports 
can be an engine for economic growth to increase employment and income in the exporting country, 
increase the efficiency of resource allocation, and achieve economies of scale (Marin 1992, Giles 
and Williams 2000). Similarly, trade expansion potentially stimulates the need for and development 
of  transport  infrastructure  (Borrone  2005,  Lee  and  Rodrigue  2006,  Beningo  2008).  Conversely, 
economic growth and infrastructure development in a country can affect trade. Domestic economic 
conditions,  including  strong  product  demand  and/or  agglomeration  economies,  can  promote 
the  growth  of  exports  (e.g.,  Leichenko  2000,  Zestos  and  Tao  2002).    In  addition,  researchers 
have  confirmed  a  positive  relationship  between  transport  infrastructure  and  trade  through  lower 
transportation cost or better infrastructure quality (Limao and Venables 2001, Nordas and Piermartini 
2004). 

The aim of this research is to revisit the long-term impact of transport infrastructure on U.S. 
economic growth by incorporating trade as an element of the analysis. Including trade in the model 
can  mitigate  the  omitted-variable  problem,  thus  improving  the  three-way  impact  estimates.  Our 
hypothesis is that enhancing transport infrastructure can increase economic output in the United 
States.  The  hypothesis  is  empirically  tested  using  a  multivariate  time-series  framework,  which 
can  address  the  issue  of  nonstationary  data  and  provide  a  clearer  understanding  of  the  long-
run  relationships  among  these  variables.  Most  importantly,  the  analysis  provides  policy  makers 
updated and more accurate information for more efficient allocation of scarce budget resources to 
infrastructure investments. 

The  remainder  of  this  article  is  organized  as  follows:  a  brief  literature  review  about  the 
relationships  among  economic  growth,  trade  and  infrastructure  is  provided  in  the  next  session, 
followed  by  an  explanation  of  the  analytical  methods. A  description  of  the  data  and  empirical 
analysis are then presented. Policy implications and conclusions are offered in the final section. 

LITERATURE REVIEW

The economic impact of transport infrastructure investment (either in terms of government spending 
on  transport  infrastructure  per  year  or  the  accumulated  stock  of  transport  infrastructure  capital) 
has  been  scrutinized  since  the  work  of Aschauer  (1989). Thorough  and  updated  surveys  of  the 

66

Transport Infrastructurerelevant literature are available in Baird (2005) and Goetz (2011). Goetz included the summary 
of the literature prior to 2000 by Bhatta and Dremman (2003) and analyzed 55 additional papers 
published on ISI Web of Science from 1999 to 2009. Among more than 100 reviewed studies, most 
find that investment in transport infrastructure supports one or more indicators of economic growth. 
Specifically, 43 of the 55 more recent studies confirm the positive role of transport infrastructure 
investment.  A  brief  summary  of  various  perspectives  on  the  role  of  transport  infrastructure  is 
presented below. 

Aschauer (1989) estimated the impact of “core” infrastructure (streets, highways, airports, and 
water systems) on economic growth and productivity in the United States during 1949−1985, and 
reported elasticities of government capital ranging from 0.38 to 0.56, and Munnell (1990)  estimated 
an elasticity of output with respect to infrastructure near 0.34 in a national study. However, these 
estimates have been criticized because of the issues of spurious relationships, simplified structural 
form and the aggregated data used for analysis (Gramlich 1994). Using the data from 48 contiguous 
states, Munnell and Cook (1990) reported a lower output elasticity of public capital of 0.15. The use 
of less aggregated state or county data by others also yielded smaller positive effects of transport 
infrastructure  on  economic  growth  (e.g.,  Berechman  et  al.  2006,  Pereira  and Andraz  2012).  In 
addition, a number of case studies for particular states or counties suggested positive impacts of 
highway and street infrastructure development on local or regional economic activity (e.g., Babcock 
and Leatherman 2011, Wang et al. 2013). Other researchers measured the “broader” economic effects 
of transport infrastructure by considering the spillover (indirect) effects on neighboring geographic 
areas, attempting to enhance the precision of the effects of infrastructure (Cohen 2010, Tong et al. 
2013). Besides, others confirmed the positive effects of transport infrastructure on activities in the 
private sector (e.g., Hodge et al. 2003, Horst and Moore 2003).

Conversely,  a  few  studies  found  no  effect  (or  mixed  effects)  of  infrastructure  capital  on 
economic growth.  For instance, Tatom (1993) found no effect of public capital on productivity 
growth after making adjustments for a spurious regression problem. Similarly, Garcia-Mila et al. 
(1996) generated a state-level production function with three forms of public capital—highways, 
water  and  sewage  systems,  and  all  other  public  capital—as  inputs,  and  found  no  evidence  of 
their effect on productivity. Another group of studies considered the spillover effects of transport 
infrastructure  and  reported  that  the  development  of  transport  infrastructure  in  one  location  may 
simply relocate economic activity from that location to others, yielding no (or negative) impact 
on  regional  economic  output  (Holtz-Eakin  and  Schwartz  1995,  Chandra  and  Thompson  2000, 
Chalermpong 2004). Moreover, some argued that, because the modern transport system already 
exist in the nation, additional infrastructure investment has little impact on economic output, and the 
impact, if any, varies across regions (Ewing 2008, Peterson and Jessup 2008).

In addition to the mixed effects of transport infrastructure on economic growth found in previous 
empirical studies, the direction of the causal relationship remains unclear. Kessides (1996) suggests 
that  simultaneity  makes  research  concerning  the  impact  of  transport  infrastructure  on  economic 
growth  tenuous,  because  economic  growth  can  lead  to  development  of  the  transport  system. 
Extending  the  related  literature,  Fisher  (1997)  discussed  the  potential  importance  of  accounting 
for the possible reverse impact of economic growth on public capital development. The ambiguity 
about the causal relationship between transport infrastructure and economic growth suggests the 
need for further research on the economic benefits of investment in transport infrastructure (Nguyen 
and Tongzon 2010).

Another group of studies has focused on the relationship between transport infrastructure and 
trade. Many studies have concluded that infrastructure development has a positive effect on trade 
through lower transport costs. Using a panel of bilateral trade-flow data for 1988-2002, Francois 
and Manchin (2013) concluded that transport infrastructure not only increases trade volumes, but 
also increases the probability of trade occurring. Park and Koo (2005) suggested that the impact of 
telecommunication investment on agricultural trade in importing OECD countries is more important 

67

JTRF Volume 53 No. 1, Spring 2014than in exporting countries. In addition, Nordas and Piermartini (2004) suggested that quality of 
transport infrastructure is an important determinant of trade expansion, and port efficiency is the 
most crucial among all infrastructure indicators. 

Some  studies  suggested  that  growth  in  international  trade  stimulates  public  infrastructure 
development.  Since  trade  is  a  demand  determinant  for  transport  and  logistics,  growth  in 
international trade will affect their growth (Lee and Rodrigue 2006). Growth in trade between the 
United States and China has placed greater demands on the U.S. transportation system over the 
last two decades (Beningo 2008). Wilson et al. (2005) measured the relationship between trade 
facilitation  and  trade  flows  in  manufactured  goods  across  75  countries  during  2000-2001. They 
concluded that differences in the quality of logistics and trade facilitation were related to trade in 
all regions.                                                                                                                                              
Another  strand  of  literature  involves  the  interaction  between  foreign  exports  and  economic 
growth. Most studies concluded that trade benefits economic development by increasing income and 
employment. For example, countries that trade a higher proportion of their GDP have higher incomes 
(Frankel and Romer 1999, Irwin and Tervio 2002); exports contribute to economic development via 
job creation at the state level in the United States (Coughlin and Cartwright 1987, Nishiyama 1997); 
and Marin (1992) failed to reject the export-led growth hypothesis for the United States, Japan, 
United  Kingdom,  and  Germany.  Conversely,  many  researchers  have  found  evidence  of  reverse 
causality between exports and economic growth. For instance, Leichenko (2000) investigated the 
causal relationships among exports, employment, and production in U.S. states and regions during 
1980-1991 and found bidirectional causality between exports and state economic growth.

Although  substantial  literature  has  investigated  the  causal  relationships  between  public 
infrastructure and economic growth, trade and economic growth, or public infrastructure and trade, 
little research has evaluated the interactions among these three closely related factors, except recent 
studies of developing countries by Khadaroo and Seetanah (2008) and Sahoo and Dash (2012). 
Khadaroo and Seetanah (2008) applied a vector error correction model to evaluate the impact of 
public infrastructure (divided into transport and non-transport), trade openness, private capital, and 
education level of labor on Maruritius’ GDP. Their results suggest that all factors had positive impacts 
on output over 1950–2000, while GDP did not affect public infrastructure capital. Sahoo and Dash 
(2012) included trade, infrastructure, and labor and capital inputs in the production functions for 
South Asian countries to evaluate the effects of public infrastructure on output. They concluded that 
infrastructure development and exports positively affected output and observed a feedback impact 
from output to infrastructure development. 

METHODOLOGY

This study adopts vector autoregression (VAR) models to evaluate the dynamic relationships among 
economic  output,  trade,  and  transport  infrastructure. The VAR  model  has  been  commonly  used 
when dynamic feedback among evaluated variables is hypothesized (e.g., Cullison 1993, Kamps 
2005). An additional advantage is that a priori causality directions are not needed between variables 
(Sturm 1998), which fits the purpose of this study well. In a VAR model, each variable is explained 
by its own lagged values and the lagged values of the other endogenous variables (Sims 1980). 

Before applying the typical VAR model, integration/non-stationarity of the time-series variables 
is examined through unit root tests, because conventional asymptotic theory is not applicable to 
hypothesis testing of non-stationary series (Sims et al. 1990). Hence, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller 
test (ADF, Dickey and Fuller 1979) was employed to test whether each variable is stationary. The 
ADF test can be presented as:
(1)   

68

Transport Infrastructurewhere At is the given time series,  is the first difference operator, and  μt represents an i.i.d. residual 
term. The optimal lag length, n, is determined by the Schwarz Bayesian criterion (SBC, Schwarz 
1978). The null hypothesis of the ADF unit root test is the coefficient of the lagged variable equals 
zero (ρ	= 0). Failing to reject the null indicates a unit root exists in the data series. The Phillips-
Perron unit root test (PP, Phillips and Perron 1988) was also conducted. This test has a similar 
null hypothesis, but uses a nonparametric adjustment to the ADF test allowing for dependence and 
heterogeneity in the residuals.

If ADF and PP unit tests suggest that more than one of the evaluated variables are integrated, 
a cointegration test must be conducted to determine if the linear combination of those variables is 
stationary. If cointegration is found among the variables, a vector error correction model (VECM) 
is appropriate. However, the commonly used cointegration tests developed by Engle and Granger 
(1987) and Johansen (1988) have size distortion if the variables have roots close to unity but not 
exact unit roots (Elliott 1998). Moreover, the estimation of the VECM is sensitive to the results of 
the cointegration test, which likely results in severe over rejections of the null hypothesis (Clarke 
and Mirza 2006).

The  statistical  inference  issue  of  unit  roots  and  cointegration  tests  is  addressed  in  the  lag-
augmented VAR (LA-VAR) model suggested by Toda and Yamamoto (1995). The LA-VAR model 
can  be  estimated  without  taking  differences  of  the  data  and  applying  a  Wald  test  for  causality 
between variables. Most importantly, it is applicable to variables that are stationary and integrated 
or cointegrated (Kawakami and Doi 2004); hence, avoiding the statistical-inference uncertainty of 
the cointegration test in the VECM model. A comparison of common methods for detecting Granger 
non-causality found that the LA-VAR method exhibits consistent performance over a wide range 
of data-generating processes and performs better in controlling Type I error probability (Clarke and 
Mirza 2006). 

A conventional VAR model of n-vector time series variables, with k lags is written as:

(2)    

where Vt is an n × 1 vector of series at time t, γ0 is an n × 1 vector of constants, γ1  is an n × 1 vector 
of coefficients, T is a time trend,  βi are n × n matrices of coefficients, and εt is an n × 1 vector of 
i.i.d. innovations (residuals) with n × n covariance matrix ∑. Similar to Khadaroo and Seetanah 
(2008), six variables were considered in the present study (i.e., n=6), including aggregated economic 
output (Y), aggregated exports (X), transport infrastructure (H), non-transport public capital (G), 
private capital (K), and labor (L), to capture the completeness of their interactions in an extended 
classical economic growth model. The LA-VAR model is generated by adding additional lags up to 
dmax , which is determined by the maximum order of integration in the system. For example, if the 
maximum order of integration of evaluated variables were one (i.e., taking first differences of the 
variables to make them stationary over time), dmax , and the LA-VAR model would be:

(3) 

A modified Wald test can be conducted on the first k order of a LA-VAR (k + dmax	) system 
to test if any given variable is Granger caused by other variables (Granger 1969). The Granger 
causality test examines whether a variable is predicted by its own past information and the past 
information of other evaluated variables. Therefore, the null hypothesis imposes the following re-
striction on equation (3):
(4)  H0 = β1 = β2 = ... = βk	= 0

69

JTRF Volume 53 No. 1, Spring 2014Rejecting the null hypothesis implies that the past information of other variables Granger causes the 
variable at time t.

Although the Granger causality test identifies causal relationships among variables, it cannot 
show other endogenous variables’ responses to a one-time shock to an endogenous variable. Also, 
as the coefficients of a VAR model are difficult to interpret, an innovation accounting based on 
a  moving  average  representation  (MAR)  may  be  an  alternative  means  to  illustrate  the  dynamic 
structure of evaluated variables (Sims 1980, Swanson and Granger 1997). An impulse response 
function generated from the MAR of equation (3) is used to explain how long and to what extent one 
variable reacts to an exogenous shock to another variable over time. These responses are revealed 
by the generalized impulse response functions (GIRF) proposed by Koop et al. (1996) and Pesaran 
and Shin (1998). Unlike the orthogonalized impulse responses that use a Cholesky decomposition 
to define the contemporary relationships of the variables (Sims 1980), the main advantage of this 
generalized approach is that the responses are invariant to the ordering of variables (Hurley 2010). 
The statistical significance of each GIRF is evaluated by 95% confidence intervals using standard 
error  generated  by  the  Monte  Carlo  method  (Lütkepohl  2000).  The  method  generates  the  non-
standard asymptotic distribution of the standard error using 6,000 randomly sampled replications.

DATA

Aggregate  economic  output  (Y)  is  measured  by  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  while  the  trade 
variable (X) is measured by the value of exports. The value of exports is selected as a proxy for trade 
in the analysis since exports are more relevant in the trade and growth literature. Also, Zestos and 
Tao (2002) suggested the value of exports Granger causes GDP in the United States, but found no 
evidence of causality from imports to GDP. The transport infrastructure variable (H) is measured 
by the value in current dollars of the net stock of government fixed assets in highways and streets 
after accounting for depreciation. This study uses highway and street infrastructure to represent 
transport infrastructure because highway and street infrastructure is the largest single category of 
public infrastructure capital (Bhatta and Drennan 2003) and is commonly used in the literature when 
evaluating the economic impact of transportation infrastructure (Baird 2005). The U.S. Bureau of 
Economic Analysis shows that highway and street infrastructure accounted for 32% of the estimated 
$9.2 trillion in government fixed assets in 2010, excluding national defense (USBEA 2011). 

Non-transport  capital  (G)  is  measured  by  the  value  in  current  dollars  of  the  net  stock  of 
government  fixed  assets,  excluding  national  defense  and  highways  and  streets.  Private  capital 
(K) is measured by the value in current dollars of private nonresidential fixed assets, consisting 
of equipment, software, and structures; and labor (L) is hours worked by full-time and part-time 
employees in domestic industry. Annual data for all six variables were obtained for 1950 through 
2006 from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (USBEA 2011). All variables are measured in 
billions of dollars (except L) and converted to logarithms (Figure 2). The observed upward trends 
suggest the existence of unit roots. 

EMPIRICAL RESULTS

The ADF and PP unit root tests are summarized in Table 1. For most data series in levels, both tests fail 
to reject the null of a unit root with or without trend. Both tests find variables are generally stationary 
after taking first differences, suggesting the maximum order of integration, dmax, is one. The optimal 
lag length, k, suggested by the SBC criterion is also one. Based on	dmax and the optimal k, equation 
(3) becomes a two-lag LA-VAR. Residuals from the U.S. LA-VAR model are well behaved. The 
test for normality of the residuals is not rejected (p-value of 0.97). Lagrangian multiplier (LM) tests 
for third and fourth order autocorrelation fail to reject the null of white noise residuals (p-values

of 0.30 and 0.18). In addition, the multivariate LM tests for first order autoregressive conditional 
heteroskedasticity (ARCH) residuals (p-value of 0.15) suggest a constant residual variance.   

Table 2 presents the results for the Granger causality tests from the LA-VAR procedure. Highway 
and street infrastructure capital (H) does not Granger cause economic output (Y). However, evidence 
suggests a strong causal effect (1% significance level) of economic output on highway and street 
infrastructure. Non-transport public capital (G) and private capital (K) Granger cause aggregated 
economic output at 5% and 10% levels, respectively, with no significant causal effects from the other 
direction. Results suggest both highway and street capital and non-transport infrastructure capital 
Granger cause exports (X) at the 5% and 10% levels, respectively. This finding is consistent with 
previous literature that found a positive effect of transport infrastructure on trade (e.g., Limao and 
Venables 2001, Nordas and Piermartini 2004, Francois and Manchin 2013). However, the reverse 
causal impacts from exports to highway and street capital or non-transport public infrastructure 
capital are not observed.

Transport InfrastructureA  causal  relationship  is  also  found  between  the  public  infrastructure  capital  variables—
highway and street capital Granger causes non-transport infrastructure at the 5% level. This causal 
relationship implies that other public infrastructure capital increases when accessibility improves. 
After the road systems are put in place, development of the non-transport infrastructure (e.g., office 
buildings,  schools,  and  power  lines)  follows. A  similar  causal  relationship  is  observed  between 
highway and street infrastructure and private capital—highway and street infrastructure Granger 
causes private capital stock at the 5% level. This result suggests that improved accessibility attracts 
private capital investment, i.e., the crowd-in effect. In addition, a weak causal effect of labor (L) on 
highway and street infrastructure is observed at the 10% level. 

The GIRF relating GDP (Y), exports (X), highway and street capital (H), non-transport public 
capital (G), private capital (K), and labor (L) to each other based on the estimated LA-VAR are 
depicted in Figure 3. Each panel in the figure presents a variable’s response (the bold line) and the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval (the dash lines) to a one-time shock in another variable 
over 20 years. The number on the vertical axis represents the change in the evaluated variable (a 
scale of 0.01 refers to a 1% change), while the number on the horizontal axis is the number of years 
following one positive shock in another variable. 

In  panel  (a1),  the  effect  of  increased  exports  on  economic  output  is  positive  in  the 
contemporaneous year (only effects that are significant at the 5% level are discussed onwards unless 
otherwise indicated). A one-time positive shock in transport infrastructure capital does not create a 
significant effect on national GDP (a2), while an increase in non-transport public capital positively 
affects economic output for six years (a3). Panels (a4) and (a5) show that a one-time increase in 
private capital and labor can also contribute to economic output over three to four years. 

Panel (b1) shows that an increase in aggregated output enhances exports instantaneously and 
into the following year. An increase in non-transport public capital stimulates national exports over 
a three-year horizon (b3). Exports also expand instantly when private capital and labor increase (b4 
and b5). The GIRF in panel (c1) suggests that a one-time positive shock in aggregated output has a 
positive lagged effect on government spending on highways and streets, while a one-time expansion 
in non-transport infrastructure capital creates a positive impact on highway and street infrastructure 
capital over six years (c3). Similar to the impact of output, a one-time increase in private capital 
posts a lagged impact on highway and street infrastructure (c4).

The GIRFs for non-transport public infrastructure in panels (d1) through (d5) show that one-
time  shocks  in  aggregated  output,  exports,  highways  and  streets,  private  capital,  and  labor  all 
positively affect the formation of non-transport public infrastructure capital. The GIRFs for private 
capital show that an increase in highway and street capital affects private capital formation in the 
contemporaneous  period  in  panel  (e3),  while  investment  in  non-transport  public  infrastructure 
capital positively produces a longer impact on private capital in panel (e4). These results provide 
evidence that public infrastructure investments attract (or crowd-in) private capital development. 
Also, a one-time expansion in GDP, exports, non-transport infrastructure capital, and private capital 
elicit positive impacts on labor use (f1, f2, f4, and f5, respectively).  

CONCLUSIONS AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS

This paper analyzes the dynamic relationships among transport infrastructure, economic output, 
and exports in the United States using the LA-VAR approach developed by Toda and Yamamoto 
(1995).  The  results  can  be  summarized  as  follows.  First,  in  contrast  to  some  previous  studies 
supporting a direct economic impact of transport infrastructure, results from both Granger causality 
tests  and  generalized  impulse  response  functions  in  our  study  do  not  suggest  a  direct  effect  of 
transport  infrastructure  on  aggregated  economic  output,  while  causality  from  economic  output 
to  transport  infrastructure  formation  is  observed.  Second,  aggregate  non-transport  infrastructure 
capital (e.g., educational structures, power, sewer and water systems, and residential, office and

JTRF Volume 53 No. 1, Spring 2014commercial structures), excluding national defense, has sustainable positive effects on economic 
output and exports over several years. Third, evidence shows that both transport and non-transport 
public infrastructure Granger cause aggregated exports. Fourth, impulse response functions suggest 
that economic output and exports react to each other immediately. Finally, results suggest that the 
development of non-transport infrastructure capital creates multiple-year positive impacts on private 
capital formation and employment.

Similar to Cullison (1993), our findings suggest that expanding transport infrastructure capital, 
represented by highways and streets, provides relatively short and indirect impacts on aggregated 
economic output compared to expanding non-transport public infrastructure. The relatively vague 
economic impact of transport infrastructure capital found in this study is of little surprise, since 
a  developed  economy,  where  substantial  highway  and  street  infrastructure  already  exists,  may 
experience a weaker influence of transport infrastructure investment than observed in developing 
economies (Talley 1996). Also, public transport infrastructure, such as interstate highways, may only 
affect the spatial allocation of economic activity, leaving the total net economic impact unaffected 
(Chandra  and  Thompson  2000).  This  finding  does  not  suggest  overlooking  the  contribution  of 
transport infrastructure capital, since both causality tests and impulse response functions imply that 
improving road systems and enhancing accessibility will affect the formation of both non-transport 
public infrastructure capital and private capital, which have positive impacts on economic output.

Several policy implications are suggested from the findings of our research. First, as concerns 
have arisen about the deteriorating 1950s Interstate Highway System and its effects on private sector 
productivity and the nation’s economy, enhancing the nation’s transport infrastructure may be crucial 
to stimulating the stagnant economy. Based on the findings of this study, investment in transport 
infrastructure will encourage private capital formation and assist in the formation of other public 
infrastructure,  both  of  which  in  turn  support  economic  growth. The  resulting  economic  growth 
will then encourage an increased allocation of resources toward public transport capital formation, 
perpetuating a cycle of public investment, private investment and economic growth. The recently 
reauthorized  surface  transportation  bill,  MAP-21,  is  an  example  of  the  Obama Administration’s 
intention to stimulate the economy through enhanced public transport infrastructure investment.

Second, the insignificant direct impact of transport infrastructure capital on economic output 
may imply that the nation’s highways and streets are not well managed (e.g., issues of congestion and 
traffic safety) or maintained, hence, lowering the economic impact of investment in the nation’s road 
systems. Talley (1996) indicated that spatial accessibility and transportation quality-of-service are 
important when evaluating the economic impact of transport infrastructure investment. Moreover, 
the road system may not be efficiently utilized, limiting its contribution to the national economy. 
Thus, along with increasing the transport infrastructure capital stock, greater economic impact may 
result from policies that better manage and utilize the nation’s road system. 

Third,  given  current  global  economic  stagnation  and  the  domestic  budget  crisis,  the  results 
suggest that the U.S. government efficiently allocate scarce budget resources toward crucial public 
infrastructure formation. Allocating resources to highway and street infrastructure can encourage 
the cycle of public investment, private investment, and economic growth, while investing in non-
transport  public  infrastructure  can  provide  positive  sustainable  effects  on  economic  output  and 
exports. As suggested by Garrison and Souleyrette (1996) nearly two decades ago, policy makers 
should encourage innovations integrating transportation services with improvement in other sectors 
to enhance and sustain the value of transport infrastructure. 

The current study aggregated all highway and street infrastructure into one category. Future 
research  is  needed  to  explore  the  economic  impacts  of  highway  and  street  infrastructure  by 
disaggregating it into several categories since not all categories would have the same impact on 
GDP (e.g., interstate highways versus county roads). The economic gains from spending on highway 
networks linking shipping ports or investment in the state highways with the highest likelihood 
for increasing local private capital investment can be analyzed, compared, and used to prioritize 

76

government spending on Intelligent Transportation Systems and their operation, or on reducing the 
hours of congestion on highways, can be included to further evaluate the impact of transportation 
infrastructure on the national economy.
