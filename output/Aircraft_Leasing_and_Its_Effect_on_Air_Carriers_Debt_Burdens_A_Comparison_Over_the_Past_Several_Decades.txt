Aircraft Leasing and Its Effect on 
Air Carriers Debt Burdens: A Comparison 
Over the Past Several Decades

by Richard Gritta and Ellen Lippman

Leasing	has	always	been	an	important	source	of	finance	to	carriers	in	the	U.S.	airline	industry.		In	
the	1960-1970s,	many	carriers	employed	a	type	of	lease	called	a	financial	lease	as	an	alternative	
source	of	funds	to	acquire	aircraft.	It	had	a	major	advantage	over	purchasing	the	aircraft.		It	was	
“off-the-balance	sheet	financing,”	as	the	obligations	under	this	type	of	lease	appeared	only	in	the	
footnotes	to	carrier	balance	sheets.		Little	use	was	made	of	short-term	lease	agreements	during	this	
period.		The	situation	has	changed	radically	over	the	past	three	decades.		In	1976,	the	Financial	
Accounting	Standards	Board	issued	SFAS	No.	13	defining	specific	criteria	for	capital	leases	that	
required	the	reporting	of	these	“off-the-balance	sheet	financing”	as	both	a	leasehold	asset	and	a	
long-term	liability	recorded	under	the	long-term	debt	section	of	the	balance	sheet.		In	response,	
the	air	carriers	substantially	altered	the	way	they	finance	airplanes.		Carriers	began	to	lease	more	
and	more	of	their	aircraft,	but	they	did	so	by	structuring	leases	as	shorter-term	operating	leases,	
which	are	not	reported	on	companies’	balance	sheets.	By	strategically	violating	the	criteria	for	
capital	leases,	the	air	carriers	once	again	pushed	the	leases	off	the	balance	sheet.	The	purpose	of	
this	research	is	to	demonstrate	the	switch	in	the	characteristics	of	aircraft	leasing	and	to	quantify	
the	effects	of	such	leases	on	air	carrier	debt	burdens.		In	the	process	it	will	be	argued	that	“debt	is	
debt”	no	matter	how	it	is	structured.	The	paper	updates	two	research	studies	by	the	authors	to	2008.

INTRODUCTION

Increasingly,  airlines  are  experiencing  financial  difficulties.  Prior  to  1978,  few  airlines  declared 
bankruptcy due to the regulated nature of the airline industry; however, since then, over 155 air 
carriers have declared bankruptcy and reorganized or ceased operations, and this rate has increased 
in recent years. Just since the year 2000, more than 50 airlines have declared bankruptcy.1  The 
airlines include both small air carriers and some of the larger airlines including United, Delta, and, 
recently,  Japan Airlines.    Some  airlines  have  responded  to  their  financial  troubles  by  merging; 
for instance, Delta and Northwest Airlines merged as did America West and USAir. Air carriers 
also have responded by attempting to strengthen their operations and financial statements.  One 
mechanism to strengthen a financial statement is through the increased usage of operating leases 
for aircraft purchases.  Prior studies (Gritta 1974; Gritta, Lippman, and Chow 1994) have discussed 
the increased usage of leases over purchases of aircraft. This study updates that data, specifically 
identifying changes in leasing activity from the 1990s to 2008, to determine how leasing behavior has 
changed over time and the effect of such changes on the financial statement. Additionally, proposed 
changes  in  the  reporting  of  lease  accounting,  as  offered  jointly  by  the  International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), are discussed and 
the potential effect of these proposals on the airline industry is considered.

PRIOR RESEARCH

Gritta (1974) reviewed aircraft lease accounting by US domestic airlines. The carriers he studied 
included  American,  Eastern,  TWA,  United,  Braniff,  Continental,  Delta,  National,  Northeast, 
Northwest, and Western Air Lines. He found that these airlines leased 317 aircraft, representing 

101

Aircraft Leasing
19.2%  of  their  entire  fleet.  The  actual  incidence  of  leases  ranged  from  zero  planes  leased  for 
Northwest, Delta, and Continental, to 83% leased by Northeast.  Accounting standards in effect then 
did not require capitalization of lease payments. Thus, airlines could structure purchases of aircraft 
as leases to avoid recording the asset and related liability associated with the purchase. To determine 
the effect of structuring purchases as leases, Gritta (1974) capitalized the lease payments using a 
present  value  of  future  cash  flows  methodology.  Gritta  (1974)  capitalized  only  those  long-term 
leases characterized as financial leases per Vancil’s definition of a finance lease.2 These included 
leases with rentals that exceeded the purchase price of the equivalent asset, or a contract lease term 
equal to the useful life of the plane. Operating lease payments were not capitalized.  

Table 1 lists two debt ratios from the 1974 study that compared the ratios before and after lease 
capitalization. The ratios include total debt to equity and long-term debt to total capital (defined as 
long-term debt and equity).

As is evident from Table 1, the ratios for many of the airlines were significantly, and negatively, 

affected by the capitalization of finance leases.  

Subsequent to the Gritta (1974) study, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standard  (SFAS)  No.  13  (1976)  that  established  criteria  to  classify  leases  as  either  capital  or 
operating. For lessees, SFAS No. 13 defines leases as capital leases if they meet one of these four 
criteria: lease term at least 75% of the useful life of the asset, present value of the lease payments at 
least 90% of the fair value of the asset at the date of lease inception, a bargain purchase, or a transfer 
of ownership at the end of the lease. Capital leases are, in substance, a purchase of an asset, and 
SFAS No. 13 mandates that the asset and related lease obligation be recorded on the balance sheet 
of the lessee at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments.3  Payments 
for leases classified as operating leases continue to be expensed annually. Thus, as Gritta (1974) 
advocated, finance leases are now capitalized on the financial statements. However, operating leases 
are not capitalized, so opportunities for manipulation of the financials continue to exist if firms 
manage lease terms to characterize leases as operating.  

102

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010
Gritta capitalized lease payments only for those leases he characterized as finance leases.  Had 
current accounting rules been used in the original study, Gritta (1974) would have classified more 
leases as capital leases than those capitalized in the 1974 study.  However, the percentage of non-
finance leases in the original study was not significant.  Leased aircraft amounted to only 19.2% of 
the total fleet of 1,651 (317 leased/1,651 total aircraft). Of those 317 leased aircraft, only 41 (13%) 
were not classified as finance leases, just 2.5% of the total fleet (Gritta 1974, p. 48).

Gritta, Lippman, and Chow (1994) conducted a follow-up study on airline leasing by the major 
airlines to determine whether the usage of leases had changed post SFAS No. 13 and to calculate 
the impact, if any, on the financials from airlines’ usage of operating leases. Since the 1974 study, 
several  airlines  included  in  the  original  study  had  ceased  operations  (Eastern  and  Braniff)  and 
several others (National, Western, and Northwest) had merged with other airlines. The follow-up 
study included the remaining airlines from the 1974 study (American, TWA, United, Continental, 
and Delta) as well as new major airlines (Alaska Airlines, Southwest, USAir, and America West).  
Gritta et. al. (1994) found two important results.  One, air carriers had increased their usage of 
leasing to 56.5% of all aircraft, and the carriers now structured a significant number of their leases 
as operating leases, something new from the 1974 study. These results are detailed in Table 2.

Additionally, when operating leases were capitalized, the effects on computed financial ratios 
were dramatic.  As evident in Table 3, typical financing ratios worsened with capitalization.  And 
the decline was more pronounced than in the 1974 study. For instance, in the 1974 study UAL’s total 
debt to equity changed 18.9% with lease capitalization; in the Gritta et al. (1994) study, UAL’s ratio 
changed 103.3%.

The  present  study  identified  the  major  U.S.  carriers  and  reviewed  their  lease  usage  in  2008  to 
determine changes since the prior studies in 1974 and 1995. The mix of airlines used in this study 
differs from past studies due to bankruptcies and mergers, suggesting continual upheaval in the 
airline industry. Table 4 documents the changes in air carriers in the current and previous studies. 

For the 1974 study, data on leasing were available from Schedule B14 previously filed with 
the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). In 1980, this information was no longer collected by the CAB. 
Now, some leasing information is available in the 10-K where the airlines identify aircraft as owned 
or leased, and then classify the leases as either capital or operating. Table 5 provides a summary of 
leasing information and compares it with the information disclosed in the Gritta et al. study (1994).

Aircraft Leasing

Overall, the usage of leasing has declined since the 1994 study from 55.2% in 1994 to 50.8%.  
But this decline is somewhat misleading.  First, for the three air carriers not included in the 1994 
study, two of the three air carriers (Southwest and Jet Blue) had lower lease rates. Historically, 
Southwest conservatively finances its business, using less traditional debt and fewer leases, while 
Jet Blue has carried high traditional debt burdens since it was founded and relies more on traditional 
sources  apart  from  leasing.  Second,  some  airlines  from  the  1994  study  (Continental,  UAL,  US 
Airways) increased the percentage of planes leased, while other airlines (Alaska, American, Delta) 
significantly decreased the percentage of leased aircraft. In the case of American and Delta, some 
leases were cancelled and aircraft returned to the lessors during the reorganizations of these airlines 
as the airlines sought to cut capacity.

While Table 5 focuses on all leasing activities, Table 6 focuses specifically on operating leasing.  
The incidence of operating leases is a better indicator of structuring leases to avoid capitalization 
than is the incidence of all lease activities.

The  percentage  of  leases  identified  as  operating  is  significant.    Alaska,  Continental,  and 
USAir structure all of their leases as operating leases. This is an increase from the 1994 study. Two 
other air carriers, Jet Blue and Southwest, structure over 90% of their leases as operating leases. 
While neither firm was in the 1994 study, such a high percentage of operating leases is significant. 
However, consistent with what was described in Table 5, Delta and American show a reduction in 
operating leases as a percentage of total leases, although the decline is not significant for American.  
For air carriers in the 1994 study, all but Delta and American increased usage of operating leases 
as a percentage of the total fleet.  Continental, UAL, and USAir have significantly increased their 
usage of operating leases for their fleet.  USAir’s percentage of fleet structured as operating leases 
is a high 100.0%.  

To determine the effect of lease capitalization upon the financials, 2008 financial data on the air 
carriers were accumulated. Table 7 details the financial data on the airlines. The liabilities and equity 
amounts are those recorded on the company’s balance sheet, while the capitalized lease amount was 
computed as a present value of operating lease payments as reported in the company’s 10-K. To 
be consistent with the two prior studies, a simple present value calculation was performed, using 
the discount rate of 10% to be consistent with the rate used in both the 1974 and 1994 studies. (In 
actuality, a lower discount rate may be appropriate currently. This would increase the capitalized 
lease amount, thereby showing a greater decline in financial health.)

The figures for current and long term liabilities were taken directly from carrier 10K balance 

sheets.  The capital leases equivalents were calculated  in the same manner as the 1994 study.4  

It is apparent that the airlines are in trouble.  American, UAL, and US Airways have negative 
equity positions as of December 31, 2008.  Delta’s positive equity is due to the adoption of fresh-
start  accounting  when  prior  accumulated  losses  were  removed  after  emerging  from  bankruptcy 
protection in 2007.  Southwest, a low cost provider, is the financially healthiest air carrier.

Using the financial information from Table 7, financial ratios were calculated to determine the 
impact of lease capitalization on debt ratios in Table 8. Total Capital is defined as the sum of long 
term debt, capitalized leases (where appropriate), and equity (the company’s stockholders equity). 
Stockholder’s equity was not adjusted for changes in classification from operating to capital leases.  
While operating lease expense will disappear with lease capitalization, depreciation and interest 
expense would increase. Over the life of the lease, these amounts will approximate one another.

Aircraft Leasing

For nearly all of the ratios, the airlines appear more risky when operating leases are capitalized.  
Yet,  do  these  changes  necessarily  affect  the  evaluation  of  the  riskiness  of  the  airlines? Table  9 
displays the ranking of the airlines’ debt ratios before and after lease capitalization. The riskiest ratio 
is labeled one, second riskiest two, and so on.

While the ratios changed, the riskiness of the firms relative to one another remained unchanged 
with or without the capitalization of the operating leases.  Thus, the capitalization of operating leases 
may not provide significantly useful information, at least when comparing one airline with another.  
While firms seem to have gone to great lengths to structure more aircraft purchases as leases, and 
more of these as operating, when comparing one air carrier with another, the capitalization of leases 
does not affect their relative riskiness as seen through the rankings.  

PROPOSAL FOR CHANGES TO LEASES AND THE EFFECTS 
ON THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

In the United States, SFAS No. 13, and now ASC 840, has been vilified as one of the worst accounting 
pronouncements in part due to the “bright lines,” the set percentages that must be met in order to 
warrant capitalized lease recognition.  Likewise, the international leasing standard IAS 17 does not 
have strong support.  In response, in March 2009 the International Accounting Standards Board and 
the FASB issued a discussion paper on leases, “Leases: Preliminary Views” (FASB 2009).  In this 
paper, the boards jointly recommended new lease accounting standards and requested comments 
about the proposal.  The boards continue to work together to craft a new lease accounting standard 
acceptable to both groups. 

The boards believe that a lease represents a right by the lessee to use an asset. “A lease is a 
contract in which a right to use a specific asset is conveyed for a period of time, in exchange for 
consideration” (FASB 2010).  The boards also believe that a lease includes an obligation to pay for 
the right to use the asset. The discussion memorandum proposes that all leases, capital or otherwise, 
should be recorded as assets and liabilities on the lessee’s balance sheet. While there exist some 
differences between the suggested lease accounting by the IASB and the FASB, the IASB and FASB 
agree on the necessity to record all leases on the lessee’s balance sheet.  In effect, it has been argued 

108

JTRF Volume 49 No. 3, Fall 2010

that “debt is debt” no matter how it is structured.

Previously, some leases were in fact purchases of assets and thus were classified as finance 
leases,  where  the  lease  and  the  related  obligation  were  recorded  as  an  asset  and  corresponding 
liability. Other leases were executory contracts, and these were classified as operating leases, with 
the  lease  payments  recorded  as  lease  expenses.  If  the  proposal  is  accepted,  capitalization  of  all 
lease  payments  for  property,  plant,  and  equipment,  regardless  of  prior  classification,  will  occur 
such that the present value of all lease payments will increase assets and liabilities. Thus, the lease 
capitalization suggested in this paper will no longer be necessary. Yet, while lease capitalization does 
impact the reported assets and liabilities, and computed ratios thereof, interestingly, the rankings of 
these ratios among the airlines were unaffected, suggesting that the public, with or without the aid of 
lease capitalization, has other financial markers to determine the riskiness of air carriers.  

Endnotes

1.  Prior to deregulation, the CAB did allow the merger of a weak carrier into a stronger one. The 
merger of Northeast Airlines, then classified as a major, into Delta in the early 1970s is an 
example. This was a way around a bankruptcy filing and thus explains the low rate prior to the 
1980s. There is also no question that the financial upheaval caused by the events of 9/11 helps 
to explain the sudden spike in filings under the bankruptcy code since 2001.

2.  Vancil defined a financial lease as a contract with non-cancelable payments that, in total, are 

greater than the cost of the item leased (Vancil and Anthony 1963).

3. 

In July 2009, all SFAS were combined into the Accounting Standards Codification that became 
the single source of authoritative accounting principles. Lease accounting is now referenced in 
ASC 840, but the leasing requirements remain the same as SFAS 13.  

4.  As noted, operating leases are not directly reflected on the balance sheets of the airlines, but the 
yearly future obligations of these leases are disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements.  
The operating lease disclosures reported in the footnotes include the yearly obligation for each 
of the next five years (LPt), and then a total of the remaining obligations (TLP) under those 
leases beyond the five years.  Just as in the 1994 (Gritta et al.) study, the fifth year lease payment 
(per the carriers’ footnotes) was estimated to continue, such that the remaining life of the leases 
per air carrier differed dependent upon the remaining balance of lease payments and year five’s 
lease payment. It should be noted that prior to the sunset of the CAB, lease forms called B-14s 
required the exact lease payments for each year of the lease, and there was no aggregating 
the payments in the future.  This makes the current analysis a little less precise than was the 
case in the 1974 study. The impact of the obligations on the balance sheet was estimated by 
determining the present value of these non-cancellable operating lease payments in a manner 
consistent with the 1994 study.  The discount rate used (10%) was the same used in both the 
1974 and 1994 studies for comparative purposes.  The following formula shows the approach 
used to estimate Lo, the net present value of the operating leases for each carrier:

+

LPt are the payments for each of the first five years presented in the carriers’ reports, k is the 
discount rate of 10%, and RLP represents an estimate of the yearly remaining lease payment 
assumed to be the same as in year five, except for the last year when it is adjusted so that total 
lease  payments  since  year  five  equal  the  total  remaining  lease  payments  as  reported  in  the

footnote. The remaining years of the lease, a, is computed by dividing the total lease payment 
after year five (TLP) by year five’s lease payments. The present values of the lease obligations 
were then included with the recorded long-term debt to compute the adjusted long term debt 
obligations for each airline.
